0	7000	Okay. All right. I heard that. It's the Thursday sigh. One more day.
7000	11000	Yeah, there we go. The Thursday sigh. It's Thursday, July 25th.
16000	21000	President Biden explained his decision to step aside in a speech from the Oval Office.
21000	26000	I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch for a new generation.
26000	28000	What's on the agenda for his remaining time in office?
28000	32000	I'm Stephen Skeep with Michelle Martin, and this is up first from NPR News.
34000	38000	Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets President Biden today
38000	42000	and will meet separately with Vice President Harris,
42000	46000	where do the President and Vice President differ on Israel and Gaza?
46000	50000	And voters are paying attention to how Kamala Harris' record on law enforcement
50000	53000	could play out in a contest against Donald Trump.
53000	58000	And you can say, this is a clear case of a prosecutor against a felon.
58000	59000	It's a home run.

136000	139000	President Biden did not want to end his bid for reelection,
139000	142000	but he said the stakes were just too high to risk it.
142000	147000	I believe I reckon as president, my leadership in the world,
147000	152000	my vision for America's future, all married at a second term,
152000	158000	but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy.
158000	161000	That includes personal ambition.
162000	167000	So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.
167000	170000	The president spoke of his decision to step aside
170000	173000	and also asserted that he still has work to do
173000	176000	in his final six months behind the Oval Office desk
176000	177000	from which he addressed the nation.
177000	179000	Joining us now to talk more about this
179000	182000	is NPR Senior White House correspondent Tamra Keith
182000	185000	up again early after a long night, Tam.
185000	186000	Yeah, good morning.
186000	187000	Thanks for doing that.
187000	190000	So what was Biden trying to accomplish with this address?
190000	194000	Well, this was a monumental moment for Biden marking the end
194000	198000	or at least the beginning of the end of a very long career in public life.
198000	202000	And his family sat lining the walls of the Oval Office as he spoke.
202000	205000	The First Lady, his grandkids, his kids,
205000	208000	he spoke as Steve said from behind the Resolute Desk,
208000	211000	this place of very serious presidential addresses.
211000	214000	And this was about explaining the very difficult decision
214000	218000	he made to step aside and putting it in a noble light.
218000	221000	He was also making an appeal to the American people
221000	223000	to think about what kind of country they want.
223000	227000	At the very end, Biden delivered this emotional expression of gratitude
227000	230000	saying that he had given his heart and soul to the nation
230000	232000	over 50 years in public life
232000	235000	and has been blessed with the love and support of the American people.
235000	240000	I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.
240000	244000	The great thing about America is here,
244000	247000	kings and dictators do not rule, the people do.
247000	250000	This wasn't the place for the overtly political language
250000	252000	you would hear at a campaign rally.
252000	255000	So he never said former President Trump's name,
255000	257000	but the subtext was quite clear.
257000	261000	It was clear, but, you know, the speech had the feeling of a farewell address,
261000	263000	but he still has six months left in office.
263000	266000	What did he say he wants to do at the time he is left?
266000	269000	You know, it really felt like the oxygen drained out of his presidency
269000	272000	when he announced he was dropping out of the race for reelection.
272000	276000	But practically speaking, this term was already in a lame duck phase.
276000	281000	His biggest achievements happened before Democrats lost control of the House in 2023.
281000	285000	So a lot of what he can do in these final months is implementation,
285000	290000	distributing funds for infrastructure and climate projects, cementing regulations.
290000	294000	He said he is going to keep fighting for reproductive rights and civil rights.
294000	297000	He's going to keep working on the economy and trying to lower costs
297000	300000	and he'll speak out against extremism and political violence.
300000	305000	And of course, he is still trying very hard to get a ceasefire for hostage's deal in Gaza.
305000	308000	Tam, we have a lot of time to talk about this, but at the end of the day,
308000	311000	how do you think his legacy will be defined?
311000	315000	Well, you know, there's been a lot of praise from Democrats about Biden's selflessness
315000	319000	since his announcement on Sunday, but the real judgment comes in November.
319000	322000	By realizing he needed to step aside at this very late date,
322000	325000	he foreclosed any possibility of a real primary.
325000	329000	Right now, Democrats are very excited about Vice President Harris as the likely nominee,
329000	332000	but this race is still very close.
332000	334000	If Harris wins, Biden will be remembered as the rare president
334000	337000	who put his party and country ahead of his ego.
337000	341000	If she loses, then he is both the person who removed Trump from office
341000	343000	and ushered him back in.
343000	347000	That is N.P.S. Tamara Keith waking up early again after another late night.
347000	348000	Tam, thank you.
348000	349000	You're welcome.
349000	362000	Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the U.S. Congress again yesterday.
362000	365000	He's given addresses to Congress four different times,
365000	368000	which is more than any foreign leader in history.
368000	369000	He's been around for a while.
369000	373000	Netanyahu's latest yesterday included flourishes,
373000	376000	often seen in a presidential state of the union address.
376000	379000	There are stories of guests in the audience to illustrate
379000	382000	and defend Israel's war against Hamas.
382000	385000	For the forces of civilization to triumph,
385000	389000	America and Israel must stand together.
389000	392000	Today, the Prime Minister meets President Biden at the White House
392000	395000	and also meets with Vice President Harris
395000	399000	how she engages Netanyahu matters more now that she's running for president.
399000	403000	NPR White House correspondent Asma Khaled is with us now to tell us more about that.
403000	404000	Good morning, Asma.
404000	405000	Good morning.
405000	409000	I wanted to ask you how you characterize the Vice President's policies on Gaza.
409000	411000	Obviously, she's the Vice President,
411000	416000	so you assume that her policies would have to be in lockstep with the presidents.
416000	420000	But what would you say about how she approaches the issue?
420000	423000	Well, the substance of what she's saying is similar to Biden,
423000	426000	but she differs in style and tone.
426000	428000	Harris did describe her as having a, quote,
428000	431000	unwavering commitment to the security of Israel.
431000	434000	I also talked with an advisor from Harris's days in the Senate,
434000	437000	and she's the only soy for who told me what it was like at a recent White House event
437000	440000	in which she saw the Vice President take on a real leadership role
440000	444000	in condemning the use of sexual violence in the October 7th attacks.
444000	446000	But really, Michelle, the real difference from Biden
446000	449000	is how Harris talks about people in Gaza.
449000	453000	Take a listen to her comments from this past March in Selma, Alabama.
453000	458000	What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating.
458000	463000	We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed.
463000	470000	Women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care.
470000	472000	I've spoken with multiple people who've remarked to me
472000	476000	that Harris shows a greater degree of empathy for Palestinian civilians
476000	479000	than they have heard publicly from Biden.
479000	482000	Have these words affected how voters see her?
482000	485000	Well, people I've spoken with in the Arab-American community
485000	489000	say that Harris is not viewed as being as toxic as Biden.
489000	491000	I was speaking to Rubel Roman.
491000	495000	She's a Democratic Georgia State Legislator, a Palestinian American,
495000	496000	and she put it this way.
496000	498000	I can tell you right now that if I had, for example,
498000	501000	tried to go to a mosque or Arab community event
501000	505000	and urged them to vote for Joe Biden, I would never be invited back.
505000	508000	The anger was so deep and the hurt was so deep.
508000	510000	Even for me, I tell people that.
510000	514000	And I think people would at least be open to hearing from her
514000	516000	and to let her make her case.
516000	519000	And some Democrats who voted uncommitted during the primaries
519000	522000	told me that they're willing to give Harris a chance.
522000	525000	I mean, to be clear, they are not saying they will definitively vote for her,
525000	527000	but there's a possibility.
527000	530000	I'll also say that Harris was one of the earlier people in the administration
530000	534000	to show a less dismissive response to some of the protests here at home.
534000	537000	Today, she is meeting separately with Israel's Prime Minister,
537000	538000	separately from Biden.
538000	540000	What do you expect from her meeting?
540000	544000	What I'm watching for is how closely she sticks to the president.
544000	547000	You know, she inherits this problem now in her campaign.
547000	550000	And following the attack in October that killed more than 1,200 people,
550000	554000	there are now more than 39,000 Palestinians who've been killed.
554000	556000	And there's still no ceasefire.
556000	559000	And some people will blame her because she is a part of this administration.
559000	561000	She has a real delicate balancing act,
561000	564000	where she's going to try not to alienate supporters of Israel,
564000	567000	who make up a key part of the Democratic Party,
567000	571000	but she's also trying to win back some of the young, progressive, brown and black voters
571000	574000	whom Biden alienated with some of his decisions about this war.
574000	577000	That is NPO's Asma Khaled. Asma, thank you.
577000	578000	Good to talk to you.
587000	590000	Vice President Harris faces another fundamental challenge.
590000	595000	To win the election, the likely Democratic nominee will have to hold together a broad coalition.
595000	597000	And they have some very different views on some issues.
597000	601000	President Biden managed this in 2020, but the coalition has frayed,
601000	604000	as we've just heard, and Harris is a different figure.
604000	607000	Her challenge becomes plain what comes to her record in law enforcement.
607000	610000	My co-host Steve Inskeep has been talking with voters in western Pennsylvania.
610000	612000	Steve, what did you find out?
612000	615000	Well, some contrasting opinions of a big part of Harris's resume.
615000	619000	Her history as a San Francisco prosecutor and California attorney general.
619000	624000	She raised this in her first campaign event while running for president,
624000	627000	talking of Donald Trump and saying as a prosecutor,
627000	630000	she knew what a predator was or a fraudster.
630000	634000	How voters take that message depends on who you talk to.
634000	638000	On NPR's morning edition yesterday, we heard Kathleen Madonna Emerling,
638000	641000	a Democratic Party activist in the Pittsburgh suburbs,
641000	643000	who really likes her new candidate.
643000	649000	My first thought was this is the ideal suburban candidate
649000	655000	because she straddles the line between being approachable,
655000	661000	relatable, joyful even, while also having incredible public safety credentials.
661000	669000	Because often in the suburbs, people want someone who is pro-public safety, pro-police.
669000	673000	Because many people in her suburb have military or police backgrounds.
673000	678000	And when you can say this is a clear case of a prosecutor against a felon,
678000	680000	it's a home run.
680000	684000	Although for some people in the Democratic Coalition, Michelle, this is a more complicated subject.
684000	689000	And I can co-sign that because I have, as they say, people of that way where you are.
689000	692000	So what is another way people see the vice president's record?
692000	695000	As a potential mark against her.
695000	699000	I also went into central Pittsburgh this week to the Hill District,
699000	703000	which is a historically black neighborhood, and talked with Adrienne Dilworth.
703000	706000	She said she had mixed feelings about Harris.
706000	710000	We spoke here while dodging cars in a grocery store parking lot.
710000	717000	I think they should have put out a broader net for candidates to see who could be actually the best
717000	722000	and not just, you know, like, okay, we're just going to push the VP for the position.
722000	725000	Why do you have mixed feelings about Vice President Harris?
725000	728000	Just some of her history.
728000	730000	We better get away from this.
730000	734000	It would be bad for the interview if you run over in the middle here.
734000	736000	Yeah, no, we're not going to have that.
736000	744000	From just some of what I'm hearing from her history of some of the people that she's had incarcerated in the past.
744000	747000	She was referring to part of Harris' record as a prosecutor.
747000	749000	She fought to put people in prison.
749000	753000	Sometimes she clashed with civil rights groups and activists over her decisions.
753000	756000	And she's been attacked over the years on the left for this.
756000	760000	Now the attack is being repeated by Republicans.
760000	767000	I guess you could say that Republicans are just trolling here, but they are also explicitly seeking some of the black vote for Donald Trump.
767000	774000	And you can see where that might resonate with some people in a community that has had this complicated, as you say, relationship with law enforcement.
774000	784000	Oh yeah, I've interviewed people in that same neighborhood in past years and I once met a voter who was 22 and said she'd already been jailed twice for things that she said she didn't do.
784000	793000	So to hold together that Democratic coalition, Harris needs law and order people and also people who are skeptical of law and order as it is sometimes practiced in the United States.
793000	795000	And we can expect her record to be scrutinized.
795000	801000	Although I should add in that same neighborhood, I also found people who were very eager to vote for Harris, excited to vote for a woman.
801000	804000	And they were organizing with a new intensity.
804000	806000	That is Steve Inskiep in Pittsburgh.
806000	807000	Steve, thank you.
807000	808000	Glad to do it.
808000	815000	And that's up first for Thursday, July 25th.
815000	816000	I'm Michelle Martin.
816000	817000	And I'm Steve Inskiep.
817000	818000	Consider this.
818000	824000	Kamala Harris will not be the first woman to lead a major party's presidential ticket, but will be the first woman of color.
824000	830000	And though her nomination is not yet official, she's already the subject of racist attacks.
830000	831000	How does that affect her candidacy?
831000	833000	Listen to consider this.
