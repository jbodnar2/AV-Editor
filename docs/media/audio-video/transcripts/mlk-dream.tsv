0	6000	I have the pleasure to present to you Dr. Martin Luther King J.R.
13000	29000	I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
30000	55000	5 score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today signed the Emancipation Proclamation.
55000	70000	This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.
71000	91000	It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity, but 100 years later, the Negro still is not free.
92000	106000	100 years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination.
107000	119000	100 years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.
120000	135000	100 years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land.
137000	144000	And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
145000	150000	In a sense, we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check.
151000	161000	When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence,
162000	170000	they were signing a promise or a note to which every American was to fall out.
171000	178000	This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men,
179000	187000	would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
188000	199000	It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promise or a note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned.
200000	209000	Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check,
210000	214000	a check which has come back marked insufficient funds.
217000	231000	But we refuse to believe that the Bank of Justice is bankrupt.
232000	241000	We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds and the great balks of opportunity of this nation.
241000	251000	So we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.
251000	270000	We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now.
271000	281000	This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.
287000	292000	Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.
293000	303000	Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.
304000	315000	Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.
315000	323000	Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.
324000	331000	It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment.
332000	344000	This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality.
345000	349000	1963 is not an end but a beginning.
350000	362000	Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.
376000	385000	And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro has granted his citizenship rights.
386000	395000	The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.
396000	405000	But that is something that I must say to my people who stand on the wrong threshold which leads into the palace of justice.
407000	415000	In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds.
416000	424000	Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of goodness and hatred.
425000	438000	We must never conduct our struggle on the high plain of dignity and discipline.
439000	446000	We must not allow our freedom to protest through degenerating into physical violence.
446000	455000	Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with sole force.
456000	465000	The marvelous new militancy which has endorsed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people.
466000	475000	For many of our white brothers as evidenced by their presence here today have come to realize that that can't be a sacrifice.
476000	490000	They have come to realize that our freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.
491000	493000	We cannot walk alone.
494000	502000	As we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.
503000	505000	We cannot turn back.
506000	513000	There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, when will you be satisfied?
514000	522000	We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of all the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.
523000	525000	We can never be satisfied.
526000	536000	As long as our body is heavy with the fatigue of travel, we cannot gain marching in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the city.
543000	552000	We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and the Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.
556000	572000	No, we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.
572000	592000	I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations.
593000	597000	Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail sales.
598000	611000	Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality.
612000	616000	You have been the veterans of creative suffering.
617000	624000	Continue to work with the faith that un-earned suffering is redemptive.
625000	638000	Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities.
639000	647000	Knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed, let us not wallow in the valley of despair.
648000	667000	I say to you today, my friend, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow,
668000	671000	I still have a dream.
672000	676000	It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
677000	689000	I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed.
690000	696000	We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.
696000	722000	I have a dream that one day on the Red Hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
722000	744000	I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
744000	759000	I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
759000	787000	I have a dream that one day down in Alabama with its vicious racist, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification,
787000	797000	one day right down in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
797000	799000	I have a dream today.
799000	819000	I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight,
819000	824000	and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.
824000	826000	This is our hope.
826000	830000	This is the faith that I go back to the south with.
830000	837000	With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.
837000	847000	With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.
847000	861000	With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together knowing that we will be free one day.
861000	874000	This will be the day, this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning my country tears at thee.
874000	882000	Sweet land of liberty of thee I sing, land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims' pride.
882000	891000	From every mountainside let freedom ring, and if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
891000	896000	So let freedom ring from the prodigious hill tops of New Hampshire.
896000	901000	Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.
901000	906000	Let freedom ring from the heightening alligators of Pennsylvania.
906000	910000	Let freedom ring from the snow-capped rockies of Colorado.
910000	915000	Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.
915000	921000	But not only that, let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.
921000	926000	Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.
926000	934000	Let freedom ring from every hill and mole hill of Mississippi, from every mountainside.
934000	950000	Let freedom ring and when this happens, when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city,
951000	961000	we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics,
961000	967000	will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual.
967000	973000	Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, we are free at last.
980000	982000	Thank you.
