All right, Elsa, you're our guest.

34

We want to make you feel welcome, you know, happy.

35
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,880
Which topic do you want to start with first?

36
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,280
Well, of course I want to start with the gesticulating chimpanzees.

37
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:49,940
Right.

38
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:54,220
Let me ask, do they use their hands as much as I do to communicate?

39
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,800
Okay, yeah, chimps definitely do.

40
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,100
I mean, they don't have full-blown language like we do, so gestures are really important for communication.

41
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,140
Can I show you a clip of that?

42
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,040
Oh, yes, please.

43
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,720
Okay, so these are two chimpanzees in a tree.

44
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,200
They just had some conflict.

45
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,280
And you can see that one chimp reaches for the other chimp's hand like, I'm sorry.

46
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,200
And after a pause, the other chimp gently taps their hand back.

47
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,200
It looks so tender.

48
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,800
I'm watching this, like, they're really making up.

49
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,520
Is that happening?

50
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,120
Yeah, I mean, maybe.

51
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,220
So, like, gestural exchanges like this are the topic of a recent paper in the journal Current Biology.

52
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:39,780
Gal Badihi is a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and the lead author of this paper.

53
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,700
And my part was the East African chimpanzees.

54
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,500
Sweeping an enormous data set, Gal looked at exchanges among five wild chimpanzee populations.

55
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,900
Usually, these exchanges had, like, two parts, hand reach, hand tap back.

56
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,000
But sometimes, these exchanges had up to seven parts, which was super exciting to see.

57
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,080
Because they seem to have this back and forth in a face-to-face communicative setup

58
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,220
that kind of resembles human conversations a little bit more.

59
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,560
That's so cool.

60
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,200
And they're sure that it has nothing to do with the sounds that they're uttering towards each other.

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,460
It's just the gestures?

62
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,900
Well, they are making sounds, but the gestures is what they were really paying attention to

63
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,480
because of the pacing of the gestures.

64
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,520
Like, the back and forth was really similar to human conversation.

65
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,600
The pause between a gesture and a gestural response averaged to about 120 milliseconds.

66
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,540
This is really fast.

67
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,900
Okay, well, how close is that to human response?

68
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,060
Yeah, conversational turns and humans averaged to about 200 milliseconds across language.

69
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,560
Again, all very rapid fire, all very fast.

70
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,860
I had no idea there was a rate.

71
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,280
Anyway, if chimps are supposed to be like one of our closest living relatives, right?

72
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,260
Like, does this reveal anything about the evolution of how humans communicate?

73
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,520
It presents an intriguing possibility.

74
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,540
Yeah, that this kind of back and forth communication may have evolved before humans split off from great apes.

75
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,340
We don't know for sure, but several primatologists I spoke to who were not a part of the study

76
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:09,080
all felt this was an important contribution to understanding how turn-taking and communication dynamics evolved.

77
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,420
No language required.

78
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,240
That is so fascinating.

79
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,400
Okay, now we're going to take a sharp turn and move to oxygen on the sea floor.

80
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,460
I take it that that is a weird thing, right?

81
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,320
Otherwise, we would not be talking about it.

82
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,060
Yeah, so most of our oxygen is created through photosynthesis.

83
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:32,000
That's when, you know, plants take in light, water, and carbon dioxide, and then they make, like, sugar and oxygen.

84
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,180
But for over a decade, scientists were aware of traces of oxygen at the bottom of the ocean,

85
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,540
like three miles down where there's no light, no photosynthesis, so where did this oxygen come from?

86
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,960
And a new study in the journal Nature Geoscience may have an answer.

87
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:55,940
It shows that oxygen produced without light, called dark oxygen, could be coming from bits of metal in the deep ocean.

88
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,880
Wait, metal? What kind of metal is in the deep sea?

89
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,400
Like, how did it get all the way down there?

90
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,840
It's these clumps of metals, like nickel, manganese, cobalt, iron, that form these nodules on the sea floor.

91
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,580
And they grow on top of stuff that falls to the bottom, like shark teeth.

92
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,200
Yeah, I talked to physical chemist Franz Geiger about this, and he's one of the paper's co-authors,

93
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,500
and he studied these clumps of metal in the lab.

94
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,580
He specified it's not a rock, and these nodules grow one millimeter per million years.

95
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:31,820
And these are a few centimeters big, so these clumps of metal accumulated over millions and millions of years.

96
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,540
Whoa.

97
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,700
Think of like a really, really slow game of Tetris.

98
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:46,200
Okay, so these clumps of metal grow very, very slowly, they glom together, and how are they producing oxygen?

99
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,880
Like, I thought that is what plants do.

100
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,060
Right, so preliminary experiment suggests it's partly through electrolysis of seawater.

101
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,960
So, electric current in the middle chunk splits ocean water, H2O, into hydrogen and oxygen,

102
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,500
but the sensors they used only detect oxygen, so they need more data before they can be like, sure this is happening.

103
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,280
That's super cool.

104
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,540
Yeah, it was surprising, actually, to the researchers, but there was another surprise that happened along the way.

105
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,000
Franz almost lost the nodules.

106
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:23,040
He got an email from customs about the package the nodules were in, and they said that soil imports aren't allowed, and they told him...

107
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,640
And I was like, what? I wasn't at faculty meeting when that happened.

108
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,900
Oh, dang customs!

109
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:38,460
Yeah, well, okay, so he then like scour the shipping rules and found that soil of oceanic origins can be imported without any issues in this save the nodule samples.

110
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,880
Soil of oceanic origin loophole!

111
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,840
Yes, okay.

112
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,380
Your legal background is coming through.

113
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,040
Yes.

114
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:53,340
I want to stay in the ocean. Our final story is about waves gone rogue. What the heck, guys?

115
00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:00,500
Yeah, so rogue waves are these abnormally large waves that seem to come out of nowhere and they endanger ships at sea.

116
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,260
Our colleague Nell Greenfield-Boys reported that advances in AI could someday help predict them.

117
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:11,760
Huh, okay, so when you say abnormally large waves, like how big are we talking?

118
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,480
For a wave to be rogue, it has to be over twice the size of the surrounding waves at a given time.

119
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,760
So it depends on the size of the waves in the area.

120
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:27,720
For centuries, scientists thought these waves were a sailing myth, until a scientific instrument managed to record one that measured 84 feet.

121
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:35,000
Yeah, and rogue waves are dangerous. They can damage ships, infrastructure, cause power failures, and really hurt people.

122
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,580
A cruise ship passenger died and others were injured when a freak wave hit the Viking Polaris in 2022.

123
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,600
Oh my god, that's terrible.

124
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,100
Yeah, there's no way of predicting them.

125
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:51,640
But a new study suggests that actually it may be possible to use information from floating buoys to give people some advanced warning.

126
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,700
So researchers have developed a computer system that correctly predicted 73% of these rogue waves five minutes before they occurred.

127
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,480
Which is valuable. It's like an earthquake warning, you know?

128
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,520
With some time, oil rig workers or ship passengers can seek shelter, perform emergency shutdowns, or evacuate.

129
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,180
If people on the ocean had a little more time, that would help.

130
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,200
Wow. Well, how did these researchers figure out how to predict these waves?

131
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:27,120
Yeah, so a researcher with the University of Maryland, Bala Balachandran, and his colleagues trained a neural network using data from 172 buoys off the coast of the continental U.S. and the Pacific Islands.

132
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:37,980
All of that data helped train the computer system to recognize waves that occurred right before a rogue wave happened, and also to distinguish them from waves that weren't followed by a rogue wave.

133
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:46,520
The scientists say they still have to improve the system's accuracy, but this could be the start of a powerful tool that could even lead to better forecasting for other extreme events.

134
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,700
That's pretty awesome.

135
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,540
