there we go. The Thursday sigh. It's Thursday, July 25th.

00:15.540 --> 00:24.880
President Biden explained his decision to step aside in a speech from the
Oval Office. I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch for a

00:24.880 --> 00:32.260
new generation. What's on the agenda for his remaining time in office? I'm
Stephen Skeep with Michelle Martin, and this is Up First from NPR News.

00:34.760 --> 00:43.320
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets President Biden today and
will meet separately with Vice President Harris, where do the President and

00:43.320 --> 00:51.480
Vice President differ on Israel and Gaza? And voters are paying attention
to how Kamala Harris' record on law enforcement could play out in a contest

00:51.480 --> 01:00.580
against Donald Trump. When you can say this is a clear case of a prosecutor
against a felon, it's a home run. Stay with us. We'll give you the news you

02:17.160 --> 02:26.220
Biden did not want to end his bid for reelection, but he said the stakes
were just too high to risk it. I believe I reckon as president, my

02:26.220 --> 02:37.520
leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all married at a
second term, but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our

02:37.520 --> 02:48.040
democracy. That includes personal ambition. So I've decided the best way
forward is to pass the torch for a new generation. The president spoke of

02:48.040 --> 02:56.740
his decision to step aside and also asserted that he still has work to do
in his final six months behind the Oval Office desk from which he addressed

02:56.740 --> 03:04.200
the nation. Joining us now to talk more about this is NPR senior White
House correspondent Tamra Keith up again early after a long night, Tam.

03:04.780 --> 03:13.060
Yeah, good morning. Thanks for doing that. So what was Biden trying to
accomplish with this address? Well, this was a monumental moment for Biden,

03:13.300 --> 03:21.660
marking the end or at least the beginning of the end of a very long career
in public life. And his family sat lining the walls of the Oval Office as

03:21.660 --> 03:30.280
he spoke. The first lady, his grandkids, his kids, he spoke as Steve said
from behind the resolute desk, this place of very serious presidential

03:30.280 --> 03:39.000
addresses. And this was about explaining the very difficult decision he
made to step aside and putting it in a noble light. He was also making an

03:39.000 --> 03:46.340
appeal to the American people to think about what kind of country they
want. At the very end, Biden delivered this emotional expression of

03:46.340 --> 03:54.120
gratitude, saying that he had given his heart and soul to the nation over
50 years in public life and has been blessed with the love and support of

03:54.120 --> 04:05.180
the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of
you. The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not

04:05.180 --> 04:13.800
rule, the people do. This wasn't the place for the overtly political
language you would hear at a campaign rally. So he never said former

04:13.800 --> 04:21.480
President Trump's name, but the subtext was quite clear. It was clear, but
you know the speech had the feeling of a farewell address, Tam, but he

04:21.480 --> 04:28.760
still has six months left in office. What did he say he wants to do at the
time he is left? You know, it really felt like the oxygen drained out of

04:28.760 --> 04:35.740
his presidency when he announced he was dropping out of the race for
reelection. But practically speaking, this term was already in a lame duck

04:35.740 --> 04:44.340
phase. His biggest achievements happened before Democrats lost control of
the House in 2023. So a lot of what he can do in these final months is

04:44.340 --> 04:52.320
implementation, distributing funds for infrastructure and climate projects,
cementing regulations. He said he is going to keep fighting for

04:52.320 --> 04:59.560
reproductive rights and civil rights. He's going to keep working on the
economy and trying to lower costs and he'll speak out against extremism and

04:59.560 --> 05:07.440
political violence. And of course, he is still trying very hard to get a
ceasefire for hostages deal in Gaza. Tam, we have a lot of time to talk

05:07.440 --> 05:13.780
about this, but at the end of the day, how do you think his legacy will be
defined? Well, you know, there's been a lot of praise from Democrats about

05:13.780 --> 05:21.620
Biden's selflessness since his announcement on Sunday, but the real
judgment comes in November. By realizing he needed to step aside at this

05:21.620 --> 05:29.380
very late date, he foreclosed any possibility of a real primary. Right now,
Democrats are very excited about Vice President Harris as the likely

05:29.380 --> 05:36.980
nominee, but this race is still very close. If Harris wins, Biden will be
remembered as the rare president who put his party and country ahead of his

05:36.980 --> 05:45.720
ego. If she loses, then he is both the person who removed Trump from office
and ushered him back in. That is N.P.S. Tamara Keith waking up early again

05:45.720 --> 05:48.640
after another late night. Tam, thank you. You're welcome.

05:56.800 --> 06:05.220
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the U.S. Congress again
yesterday. He's given addresses to Congress four different times, which is

06:05.220 --> 06:13.860
more than any foreign leader in history. He's been around for a while.
Netanyahu's latest yesterday included flourishes often seen in a

06:13.860 --> 06:22.400
presidential state-of-the-union address. He told stories of guests in the
audience to illustrate and defend Israel's war against Hamas. For the

06:22.400 --> 06:32.760
forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together.
Today, the Prime Minister meets President Biden at the White House and also

06:32.760 --> 06:41.520
meets with Vice President Harris how she engages Netanyahu matters more now
that she's running for president. NPR White House correspondent Asma Khaled

06:41.520 --> 06:47.740
is with us now to tell us more about that. Good morning, Asma. Good
morning. I wanted to ask you how you characterize the Vice President's

06:47.740 --> 06:55.840
policies on Gaza. I mean, obviously, she's the Vice President, so you
assume that her policies would have to be in lockstep with the presidents.

06:56.520 --> 07:03.960
But what would you say about how she approaches the issue? Well, the
substance of what she's saying is similar to Biden, but she differs in

07:03.960 --> 07:12.580
style and tone. Harris did describe her as having a, quote, unwavering
commitment to the security of Israel. I also talked with an advisor from

07:12.580 --> 07:19.100
Harris's days in the Senate, Hailey Soyfer, who told me what it was like at
a recent White House event in which she saw the Vice President take on a

07:19.100 --> 07:26.100
real leadership role in condemning the use of sexual violence in the
October 7th attacks. But really, Michelle, the real difference from Biden

07:26.100 --> 07:34.780
is how Harris talks about people in Gaza. Take a listen to her comments
from this past March in Selma, Alabama. What we are seeing every day in

07:34.780 --> 07:49.140
Gaza is devastating. We have seen reports of families eating leaves or
animal feed. Women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no

07:49.140 --> 07:57.200
medical care. I've spoken with multiple people who've remarked to me that
Harris shows a greater degree of empathy for Palestinian civilians than

07:57.200 --> 08:05.720
they have heard publicly from Biden. Have these words affected how voters
see her? Well, people I've spoken with in the Arab-American community say

08:05.720 --> 08:14.580
that Harris is not viewed as being as toxic as Biden. I was speaking to
Rubel Roman. She's a Democratic Georgia state legislator, a Palestinian

08:14.580 --> 08:22.400
American, and she put it this way. I can tell you right now that if I had,
for example, tried to go to a mosque or Arab community event and urged them

08:22.400 --> 08:31.880
to vote for Joe Biden, I would never be invited back. The anger was so deep
and the hurt was so deep. Even for me, I tell people that. And I think

08:31.880 --> 08:40.180
people would at least be open to hearing from her and to let her make her
case. And some Democrats who voted uncommitted during the primaries told me

08:40.180 --> 08:46.520
that they're willing to give Harris a chance. I mean, to be clear, they are
not saying they will definitively vote for her, but there's a possibility.

08:47.140 --> 08:53.580
I'll also say that Harris was one of the earlier people in the
administration to show a less dismissive response to some of the protests

08:53.580 --> 09:01.440
here at home. Today, she is meeting separately with Israel's Prime
Minister, separately from Biden. What do you expect from her meeting? What

09:01.440 --> 09:08.040
I'm watching for is how closely she sticks to the president. You know, she
inherits this problem now in her campaign and following the attack in

09:08.040 --> 09:15.920
October that killed more than 1,200 people. There are now more than 39,000
Palestinians who've been killed and there's still no ceasefire. And some

09:15.920 --> 09:23.440
people will blame her because she is a part of this administration. She has
a real delicate balancing act where she's going to try not to alienate

09:23.440 --> 09:30.940
supporters of Israel who make up a key part of the Democratic Party, but
she's also trying to win back some of the young, progressive, brown and

09:30.940 --> 09:38.640
black voters whom Biden alienated with some of his decisions about this
war. That is NPR's Asma Khaled. Asma, thank you. Good to talk to you.

09:47.060 --> 09:54.480
Vice President Harris faces another fundamental challenge to win the
election. The likely Democratic nominee will have to hold together a broad

09:54.480 --> 10:01.920
coalition, and they have some very different views on some issues.
President Biden managed this in 2020, but the coalition has frayed as we've

10:01.920 --> 10:08.480
just heard, and Harris is a different figure. Her challenge becomes plain
what comes to her record in law enforcement. My co-host Steve Inskeep has

10:08.480 --> 10:15.400
been talking with voters in western Pennsylvania. Steve, what did you find
out? Well, some contrasting opinions of a big part of Harris's resume. Her

10:15.400 --> 10:24.720
history as a San Francisco prosecutor in California Attorney General. She
raised this in her first campaign event while running for president talking

10:24.720 --> 10:34.220
of Donald Trump and saying, as a prosecutor, she knew what a predator was
or a fraudster. How voters take that message depends on who you talk to. On

10:34.220 --> 10:42.660
NPR's Morning Edition yesterday, we heard Kathleen Madonna Emerling, a
Democratic Party activist in the Pittsburgh suburbs, who really likes her

10:42.660 --> 10:55.900
new candidate. My first thought was, this is the ideal suburban candidate
because she straddles the line between being approachable, relatable,

10:56.600 --> 11:07.980
joyful event, while also having incredible public safety credentials.
Because often in the suburbs, people want someone who is pro-public safety,

11:08.280 --> 11:17.460
pro-police. Because many people in her suburb have military or police
backgrounds. And when you can say, this is a clear case of a prosecutor

11:17.460 --> 11:25.020
against a felon, it's a home run. Although for some people in the
Democratic Coalition, Michelle, this is a more complicated subject. And I

11:25.020 --> 11:33.840
can co-sign that because I have, as they say, people of that way where you
are. So what is another way people see the vice president's record? As a

11:33.840 --> 11:41.960
potential mark against her. I also went into central Pittsburgh this week
to the Hill District, which is a historically black neighborhood, and

11:41.960 --> 11:50.980
talked with Adrienne Dilworth. She said she had mixed feelings about
Harris. We spoke here while dodging cars in a grocery store parking lot. I

11:50.980 --> 11:59.800
think they should have put out a broader net for candidates to see who
could be actually the best and not just, you know, like, okay, we're just

11:59.800 --> 12:09.580
going to push the VP for the position. Why do you have mixed feelings about
vice president Harris? Just some of her history. We better get away from

12:09.580 --> 12:17.980
this. It would be bad for the interview if you run over in the middle here.
Yeah, no, we're not going to have that. From just some of what I'm hearing

12:17.980 --> 12:27.180
from what of her history of some of the people that she's had incarcerated
in the past. She was referring to part of Harris' record as a prosecutor.

12:27.440 --> 12:34.360
She fought to put people in prison. Sometimes she clashed with civil rights
groups and activists over her decisions. And she's been attacked over the

12:34.360 --> 12:42.540
years on the left for this. Now the attack is being repeated by
Republicans. I guess you could say that Republicans are just trolling here,

12:42.540 --> 12:50.160
but they are also explicitly seeking some of the black vote for Donald
Trump. And you can see where that might resonate with some people in a

12:50.160 --> 12:56.440
community that has had this complicated, as you say, relationship with law
enforcement. Oh, yeah, I've interviewed people in that same neighborhood in

12:56.440 --> 13:05.220
past years, and I once met a voter who was 22 and said she'd already been
jailed twice for things that she said she didn't do. So to hold together

13:05.220 --> 13:12.280
that Democratic coalition, Harris needs law and order people and also
people who are skeptical of law and order as it is sometimes practiced in

13:12.280 --> 13:18.760
the United States, and we can expect her record to be scrutinized. Although
I should add in that same neighborhood, I also found people who were very

13:18.760 --> 13:25.980
eager to vote for Harris, excited to vote for a woman, and they were
organizing with a new intensity. That is Steve Inskiep in Pittsburgh.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.460
Steve, thank you. Glad to do it.

13:32.020 --> 13:40.240
And that's up first for Thursday, July 25th. I'm Michelle Martin. And I'm
Steve Inskiep. Consider this. Kamala Harris will not be the first woman to

13:40.240 --> 13:47.460
lead a major party's presidential ticket, but will be the first woman of
color. And though her nomination is not yet official, she's already the

13:47.460 --> 13:56.100
subject of racist attacks. How does that affect her candidacy? Listen to
consider this. Today's episode of Up First was edited by Roberta Rampton,
