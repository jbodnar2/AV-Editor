WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.720
that I want.

00:04.120 --> 00:06.960
The other thing that I want to mention is because it's an oral history

00:06.960 --> 00:11.900
where our job is to focus on you. So when I'll ask a question and you'll

00:11.900 --> 00:16.660
notice I'll mute afterwards, but you'll see me like nodding and smiling. I

00:16.660 --> 00:19.440
know it feels weirder than when you're in like a traditional interview

00:19.440 --> 00:23.620
where you're used to hearing people go aha or laughing at things, be it on

00:23.620 --> 00:26.100
my face, but you may not hear it because we're trying to make sure that we

00:26.100 --> 00:30.800
preserve your audio. Thanks for the heads up about that. No, absolutely.

00:32.840 --> 00:37.780
Once we actually get this party started, I'm going to do things like I've

00:37.780 --> 00:43.000
got a little intro and then I'll turn it over to you. We'll kind of go back

00:43.000 --> 00:48.540
and forth with questions. Do you have questions for or about me before we

00:48.540 --> 00:52.440
get into all of your wonderful work? Well, I'd like to know a little bit

00:52.440 --> 00:56.640
more about you and your work. Yeah. Okay, absolutely. This I'm happy to

00:56.640 --> 01:02.920
talk about. It's nowhere near as exciting as your work. So I kind of am a

01:02.920 --> 01:07.420
multidisciplinary person. So my community college professor out in

01:07.420 --> 01:11.960
California, I teach in communication. My background is in communication,

01:12.720 --> 01:18.560
humanities, clearly trans history. My dissertation was focused on how we

01:18.560 --> 01:23.080
share intergenerational stories as trans people, particularly around

01:23.080 --> 01:28.760
history. So I used the site of Compton's cafeteria and did some interviews

01:28.760 --> 01:34.480
both about how we share stories about history and then how place tells us

01:34.480 --> 01:39.420
those histories. So what does it look like to have a trans space too? So

01:39.420 --> 01:44.540
the academic version is I study trans histories in material and built

01:44.540 --> 01:49.200
environment through the eyes of artists as kind of the elevator pitch for

01:49.200 --> 01:54.400
it. But other than that, like, my work has been dealing a lot with

01:54.400 --> 01:59.060
mentoring, doing some stuff around getting the private prison out of the

01:59.060 --> 02:03.680
site of Compton's cafeteria right now, and then like various and some other

02:03.680 --> 02:09.140
things. I hate for profit prisons. It's disgusting. And the fact that it's

02:09.140 --> 02:15.380
in a place that is about like a trans uprising against police is just it's

02:15.380 --> 02:19.780
I had no idea that was there. It's disgusting news. It's horrible. Yeah. So

02:19.780 --> 02:25.640
it's a project that we're working on slowly but surely. So what else? I got

02:25.640 --> 02:28.620
a cat who may or may not make an appearance. His name is Mr. Rudolph

02:28.620 --> 02:35.240
Valentino. He's got very handsome eyes. I think that's kind of the basics.

02:35.900 --> 02:41.560
Other questions? No, we have two cats and they may also show up. Oh, who

02:41.560 --> 02:48.240
are your cats? Ivory and Cleo. Cute. I love a cat. They're both rescue

02:48.240 --> 02:55.900
cats. Ivory is an Egyptian male. And she wound up on the battery of a

02:55.900 --> 03:02.740
friend's car. He was driving all around New York city and lower part of

03:02.740 --> 03:06.900
Hudson Valley. And here's a meow and he looks in and here's a six week old

03:06.900 --> 03:11.740
kitten on his battery of his Prius. Oh my gosh. We took it for a weekend.

03:12.100 --> 03:17.940
And of course, this is eight years later. Yeah, naturally, right? They

03:17.940 --> 03:22.820
capture you if they're in. And she's like, she's very much of a lady. Cleo

03:22.820 --> 03:28.680
is in many ways more like a dog than a cat. The way she likes to be petted,

03:28.880 --> 03:33.880
her size and her enthusiasm. Well, that's a good balance. Like somebody

03:33.880 --> 03:38.600
who's not boundaries and then somebody who's very boundary, right? It's a

03:38.600 --> 03:44.420
good mix. I love it. Okay, awesome. Well, with that, we're going to go

03:44.420 --> 03:47.680
ahead and get started. So I'm going to do my little intro to make it

03:47.680 --> 03:52.920
official and then go through this conversation. So thank you so much for

03:52.920 --> 03:57.260
participating. My name is AC Pinella and I'm interviewing Dallas Denny on

03:57.260 --> 04:07.540
May 1st, 2023 at 1017 a.m. Pacific time. So, Dallas, can you quickly give

04:07.540 --> 04:13.840
me like the elevator pitch of your introduction right now? How do you

04:13.840 --> 04:20.040
identify in the world, age, pronouns, where you're located currently? Sure.

04:20.360 --> 04:25.940
I'm living in a state I always swore I never live in, which is New Jersey.

04:26.200 --> 04:31.880
I moved here in 2015 and was married. I didn't think I would be married a

04:31.880 --> 04:40.700
second time, but I am and it's a very good marriage. I'm 73. My pronouns

04:40.700 --> 04:41.660
are she and her.

04:44.540 --> 04:52.120
Right. I love it. So why don't we start with a little bit about where you

04:52.120 --> 04:55.440
are right now. So you said you were never going to live in Jersey. What

04:55.440 --> 04:59.700
brought you there? Well, there were three places I didn't want to live. The

04:59.700 --> 05:03.520
first was Atlanta because I was living in Nashville because it was so

05:03.520 --> 05:11.560
large. I just thought it would be too big. And the second was New Jersey

05:11.560 --> 05:16.400
because my only experiences here had been in the industrial area near

05:16.400 --> 05:21.780
Newark where it smells bad and it's highly polluted. And the third was

05:21.780 --> 05:27.440
Kansas, which is so flat it scares me. At least the parts I've been

05:27.440 --> 05:32.660
through. And so I ended up in Atlanta for 25 years when I transitioned and

05:32.660 --> 05:36.660
now I've been in New Jersey. Oh, I came up here because I could not

05:36.660 --> 05:41.840
convince my wife to move to Atlanta. And quite frankly, now I'm worried

05:41.840 --> 05:42.640
about Kansas.

05:45.400 --> 05:54.120
I really appreciate that. So yeah, keep it on your radar and make

05:54.640 --> 05:59.780
what brought you to Atlanta. And why did you end up staying here for so

05:59.780 --> 06:07.980
long? I identified by age 13. I knew who I was. I knew that I did not have

06:07.980 --> 06:16.400
a like a identified as a woman. I did not know how to make that identity a

06:16.400 --> 06:19.840
reality. And there was no information, just zero.

06:22.100 --> 06:29.120
When I guess in the 60s, I came across an announcement of the opening of

06:29.120 --> 06:33.320
the gender identity clinic at Johns Hopkins University. And that's where I

06:33.320 --> 06:36.560
learned the word transsexuals. And that's my identity. And as I also

06:36.560 --> 06:42.720
identify as transgender, transsexual is becoming a largely obsolete

06:42.720 --> 06:50.380
identity. When transgender came into popularity in about 1993, it was an

06:50.380 --> 06:54.200
umbrella. It was considered an umbrella in which people with all kinds of

06:54.200 --> 06:58.880
gender variants would fit comfortably. Many people did not feel like they

06:58.880 --> 07:04.480
fit comfortably under it. Hated the term, but many did. And then eventually

07:04.480 --> 07:07.740
became an identity. So identify both ways now.

07:12.200 --> 07:20.160
So I continued into my 20s to have no information. And I didn't really find

07:20.160 --> 07:25.560
my tribe until the late 80s. And when I did, I found a support group in

07:25.560 --> 07:30.480
Atlanta. And for the first time in my life, I not only met other people

07:30.480 --> 07:37.760
like myself, but I realized it was a good city in which to be trans if you

07:37.760 --> 07:42.020
were going to be in the South. And I had support. I had people, you know, I

07:42.020 --> 07:47.100
had opportunity of making some money. I had a place to live and I made the

07:47.100 --> 07:53.260
jump. I transitioned and moved to Atlanta and was there until 2015 when I

07:53.260 --> 07:53.720
got married.

07:56.500 --> 08:01.040
Wow, that's a really wild moment. So when you were talking about a support

08:01.040 --> 08:06.280
group, was it a formal or informal support group? It was an organization

08:06.280 --> 08:11.400
called the Montgomery Medical and Psychological Institute. It was founded

08:11.400 --> 08:18.540
and run by a couple, Lynn and Jerry Montgomery. Lynn was a nurse at the

08:18.540 --> 08:24.840
gender clinic that was operated jointly by Emory University and the mental

08:24.840 --> 08:29.280
health center that was close to the, I guess, was on campus actually. Jerry

08:29.280 --> 08:34.060
was a trans man. And they were married and they had a support group and

08:34.060 --> 08:38.020
they were very old school in their views, kind of like, these are their

08:38.020 --> 08:42.380
girls, they have our girls, they was mostly trans women. They have a

08:42.380 --> 08:46.760
medical issue and we help them resolve it and they go have a perfectly

08:46.760 --> 08:51.840
wonderful and normal life like any other woman once, you know, they go

08:51.840 --> 08:57.200
through their transitions. I was questioning that from the beginning and I

08:57.200 --> 09:03.780
do not identify as non-binary in any way. I'm perfectly happy on my side of

09:03.780 --> 09:07.840
the binary gender divide, but I realized it's just not a fit for everybody

09:07.840 --> 09:13.820
and I realized that by the time I moved to Atlanta in 1989. And we had some

09:13.820 --> 09:18.380
difficulties because of that, but it was a monthly support group meeting.

09:18.840 --> 09:22.940
They had a good team for referrals, so there's therapists that they worked

09:22.940 --> 09:26.800
with that they referred the people do and, you know, you could go to their

09:26.800 --> 09:30.920
support group meetings, which are once a month and talk to your peers and

09:30.920 --> 09:36.820
learn new things and it was a good organization and it provided me with

09:36.820 --> 09:43.460
support and they drafted me to run the group even before I moved. How were

09:43.460 --> 09:47.120
you connecting with them before you moved? Were you were commuting back and

09:47.120 --> 09:56.360
forth? Yeah, I was coming. So I was looking for community and finding none

09:56.360 --> 10:05.040
and so in the late 70s, I started seeing some transsexuals on TV. There was

10:05.040 --> 10:10.500
Renee Richard who was in the news for playing women's tennis and she got

10:10.500 --> 10:17.380
outed. There was Jan Morris who was on the team that did the summit of, she

10:17.380 --> 10:21.760
can go to the top, but to the top of Mount Everest on the first ever

10:21.760 --> 10:29.340
successful summoning of the mountain and there was Canary Kahn who was a

10:29.340 --> 10:35.300
singer who won a song contest and was momentarily famous and transitioned.

10:35.900 --> 10:41.340
They were all on TV, often on talk shows and especially on late night shows

10:41.340 --> 10:50.040
and Renee was kind of ambivalent about her transsexualism from the get go.

10:50.680 --> 10:55.840
Jan Morris wasn't, she was this kind of this very proper older British lady

10:55.840 --> 11:00.100
and Canary, Canary looked like the prototypical California girl. She was

11:00.100 --> 11:03.740
young and she was pretty and for the first time, I thought, well, maybe I

11:03.740 --> 11:11.660
can do this. And around the same time, I learned it was a gender clinic in

11:11.660 --> 11:16.140
Atlanta, I mean, in Nashville at Vanderbilt University. I have no idea how

11:16.140 --> 11:21.100
I recollection how I learned that, but I went there. I paid, I think $300

11:21.100 --> 11:26.740
or two or $300 to join and I paid $300 to take a battery or psychological

11:26.740 --> 11:33.160
test. I'd learned to administer in graduate school. And, you know, I did

11:33.160 --> 11:35.780
the interview, I went cross-dressing, I'd been cross-dressing.

11:36.540 --> 11:44.440
Successfully, I passed very well from age 13 or 14 in public. So I take

11:44.440 --> 11:49.300
these tests, they do an examination and then tell me, essentially, I'm not

11:49.300 --> 11:53.240
screwed up enough to be transsexual. I was able to function in the male

11:53.240 --> 12:00.700
role. I had two college degrees. I worked as a Tennessee and my sexual

12:00.700 --> 12:05.960
interest was primarily towards women, so they weren't going to give me any

12:05.960 --> 12:11.820
assistance and offer me hormones or surgeries, what they said, and I kind

12:11.820 --> 12:15.600
of clicked hormones. That's the piece I've been missing. I had not figured

12:15.600 --> 12:20.420
out about hormones. My body, by this time I was in my late 20s and my body

12:20.420 --> 12:25.340
had started to masculinize, my facial here had finally come in. I was in

12:25.340 --> 12:30.340
danger of losing the hair on the top of my head and I was not a happy

12:30.340 --> 12:35.840
camper about any of that. And so they tell me, essentially, I'm not screwed

12:35.840 --> 12:42.120
up enough to be transsexual. So I go down across the quad to the medical

12:42.120 --> 12:46.820
library and spend the next three months reading the libelist medical

12:46.820 --> 12:55.600
literature about us. Stoller, Green and Money's book was out. No, yeah,

12:55.720 --> 13:00.460
Green and Money's book was out. A lot of medical articles and it was just a

13:00.460 --> 13:03.980
horror literature and it was a self-perpetuating literature. I mean, I'm

13:03.980 --> 13:07.940
like, okay, these are the professionals. They just told me I'm not

13:07.940 --> 13:12.560
transsexual, so why am I and why do I feel this way? And I read the

13:12.560 --> 13:16.980
literature and I realized, okay, they have this idea of what transsexuals

13:16.980 --> 13:20.520
are and if you're functional in any way, then you're not transsexual. But

13:20.520 --> 13:24.660
then they write these research articles based on the people they led into

13:24.660 --> 13:30.980
their programs. So it's like a snake eating its own tail. I realized this.

13:31.580 --> 13:35.600
And so I went out, I had worked in a mental hospital where I learned to

13:35.600 --> 13:40.280
read prescriptions, which essentially taught me how to write them. So I

13:40.280 --> 13:44.400
went to the only doctor I was able to locate who might treat me. He refused

13:44.400 --> 13:47.940
when I was out of the office. I lifted the top third of his prescription

13:47.940 --> 13:53.440
pad, wrote and put myself on diethylstilbestrol, which later was realized

13:53.440 --> 13:59.880
to be a dangerous estrogen, but it was very, very, very potent drug. And so

13:59.880 --> 14:04.600
I started feminized. I had been, I didn't have male pattern bonus, but I

14:04.600 --> 14:09.240
had very oily skin after puberty and very oily hair. It looked like I wore

14:09.240 --> 14:12.500
drill cream in my hair. After three hours, I could shampoo my hair and it

14:12.500 --> 14:16.720
looked like I'd drill creamed in it. And they had just figured out, I

14:16.720 --> 14:20.920
think, the medical community about dihydrotestosterone, a breakdown product

14:20.920 --> 14:25.780
of tea. And so I went to hair club for men. My hair was getting thinner

14:25.780 --> 14:31.540
over the whole top of my head. No, no, at least not much recession, but I

14:31.540 --> 14:34.180
went there and I, you know, and they said, yeah, you're going to lose your,

14:34.300 --> 14:37.640
you're going to lose all your hair by the time you 35. And I was 28, maybe

14:37.640 --> 14:40.820
all the hair on your top of your head are going to, is going to be gone.

14:40.860 --> 14:44.080
But not only that, and he pointed out that the hair on the side of my head

14:44.080 --> 14:47.300
was brittle. And he said, that's going to be gone. So they were essentially

14:47.300 --> 14:53.380
telling me I was going to be John Luke Picard by the time I was 35. And it

14:53.380 --> 14:58.320
was about that time that I put myself on estrogen and about two months

14:58.320 --> 15:03.080
later, my mother says, your hair's back. Now, I went and looked in the

15:03.080 --> 15:06.580
mirror and my hair was back. I attributed that to the fact that most of the

15:06.580 --> 15:12.160
follicles were stunted by dihydrotestosterone, but not yet dead. And

15:12.160 --> 15:17.480
without, without taking care of by the estrogen, my hair all came back. And

15:17.480 --> 15:21.440
I, and I, so I was on hormones for 10 years before I transitioned, still no

15:21.440 --> 15:31.420
idea what to do next. And had a, you know, kind of a decades long love

15:31.420 --> 15:36.880
interest in the 80s. She could not stand the idea of me being trans. And

15:36.880 --> 15:41.840
I'm like, and unlike most transsexuals, I was never have to do this or die.

15:41.980 --> 15:45.400
I was like, I can make a rational decision about what I'm going to do with

15:45.400 --> 15:49.220
my life. And I love you. And if, you know, I wasn't going to come off of

15:49.220 --> 15:52.540
estrogens, but I could have not transitioned. And I was willing to not

15:52.540 --> 15:56.380
transition. But she didn't, she didn't want me to be tea. She wanted, and

15:56.380 --> 16:00.900
then the one thing I couldn't do was not be transsexual. That wasn't out of

16:00.900 --> 16:08.240
my power, whether what I did about it was in my power. But it, she got sort

16:08.240 --> 16:12.520
of verbally abuse. Well, she didn't, she got verbally abusive. And when I

16:12.520 --> 16:18.880
saw therapist, he, he pointed, he gave me a book called Women Who Love Too

16:18.880 --> 16:24.220
Much. And she thought he was the best therapist in the world until she

16:24.220 --> 16:28.780
started reading it and saw herself. She saw me as the woman who loved too

16:28.780 --> 16:37.280
much. And she is the abusive partner. So that was a eye opener. So the

16:37.280 --> 16:41.460
other thing that happened back in the 80s was I saw a panel of Tri-S

16:41.460 --> 16:45.160
members. That's a society for the second self, which was heterosexual cross

16:45.160 --> 16:49.220
-dressers. And they were very firm about, you know, there being no

16:49.220 --> 16:54.060
transsexuals allowed and no gay cross-dressers or bi-cross-dressers,

16:54.100 --> 16:59.440
because we're all heterosexual. And I saw that I wrote down their

16:59.440 --> 17:05.320
information and I wrote them and said, I understand. I'm not eligible for

17:05.320 --> 17:09.320
membership. But please, can you put me in touch with someone who knows

17:09.320 --> 17:15.280
about transsexualism? So they gave me Virginia Prince's name. So I wrote a

17:15.280 --> 17:20.000
very agonizing and somewhat pompous letter to Virginia pleading my case and

17:20.000 --> 17:26.760
asking for help. And she did answer my questions to an extent because she

17:26.760 --> 17:30.400
talked about hormone. She had put herself on hormones for a while. She's a

17:30.400 --> 17:35.180
chemist and she told me once that she cooked up her own and took them until

17:35.180 --> 17:40.520
she had grown enough breasts to, as she put it, to

17:43.700 --> 17:48.740
satisfy Charles, her male part. And then she stopped. And at that point, I

17:48.740 --> 17:53.480
consider her a chicken shit transsexual for a long time. But then I knew

17:53.480 --> 17:57.240
she was not. I mean, things about her made me realize she was something

17:57.240 --> 18:03.720
different than I was. But she just, I got a response back from her after

18:03.720 --> 18:07.280
three weeks and just rained all over my parade. She told me I could never

18:07.280 --> 18:12.260
be female. And at the time in America and around the world, in fact, gender

18:12.260 --> 18:16.920
and sex were used synonymously. So when she told me I couldn't be female, I

18:16.920 --> 18:20.420
took that to mean I could never be a woman. She told me I would have to

18:20.420 --> 18:27.860
live a life of deception that I didn't need surgery. I was just shattered.

18:28.960 --> 18:36.140
Now, fortunately, she enclosed my original letter to her with her. And hers

18:36.140 --> 18:39.020
was on both sides of one sheet of paper. And when she ran out of room

18:39.020 --> 18:42.800
rather than put a second sheet of paper in, she typed all around the

18:42.800 --> 18:47.060
margins of the paper, which was, anyway, those are on the website, both of

18:47.060 --> 18:51.500
those. The originals are in Michigan at the University with the rest of my

18:51.500 --> 19:00.540
materials. And so I didn't join the group. I, you know, 10 years went by. I

19:00.540 --> 19:04.880
was out of the only community I had been able to identify. I was out for 10

19:04.880 --> 19:10.380
years because of her policy. And finally, things got to the point in the

19:10.380 --> 19:15.960
late 80s that I'm like, look, I know I'm not the only one in the world. I

19:15.960 --> 19:19.380
know that for a long time, but where the hell are they? You know, where the

19:19.380 --> 19:24.940
hell are my peers? Where's my tribe? And I knew that Trius was not my

19:24.940 --> 19:30.360
tribe. The heterosexual cross-dressers were not how I identified. But I

19:30.360 --> 19:35.680
thought, surely they have to be in touch with the transsexual community if

19:35.680 --> 19:39.140
there is one. So I joined Trius. Finally, I kind of held my nose and

19:39.140 --> 19:46.060
joined. I went to several meetings. And after about four months, Jessica

19:46.060 --> 19:49.580
Britton from Asheville, North Carolina came in with a copy of Capestry

19:49.580 --> 19:54.180
Magazine, which was then called TVTS Tapestry. And there was this wonderful

19:54.180 --> 20:00.100
resource listing in the back of the magazine. And I'm like, oh my God, you

20:00.100 --> 20:04.660
know, and there was a group called Montgomery Institute in Atlanta for

20:04.660 --> 20:09.800
transsexuals. I was living in East Tennessee. It was about three and a half

20:09.800 --> 20:15.200
hours maybe to Atlanta. So I started calling them. And it was three months

20:15.200 --> 20:19.500
before they picked up the phone. Someone finally picked up the phone. I

20:19.500 --> 20:22.500
came down for an interview. They were so impressed. And they gave me a copy

20:22.500 --> 20:26.300
of the Standards of Care, which was like a roadmap for me. You know, like I

20:26.300 --> 20:30.180
didn't understand about hormones for a long time. And you know, I've been

20:30.180 --> 20:34.220
on them for 10 years. But I understood about how the transition worked

20:34.220 --> 20:39.820
about the letters required to get treatment. And I started seeing a

20:39.820 --> 20:46.940
therapist, including the one that helped me realize I was in a codependent

20:46.940 --> 20:56.040
relationship. And I started having electrolysis and losing weight. And I

20:56.040 --> 21:01.660
didn't lose weight to be like some stereotypical idea of a woman. Because I

21:01.660 --> 21:06.260
was morbidly obese, I was weighing about 400 pounds. So I started losing

21:06.260 --> 21:09.980
weight and getting rid of my facial hair. And I went overnight at some

21:09.980 --> 21:14.860
point from being public, perceived as male to publicly perceived as female.

21:15.080 --> 21:19.640
All my life, I was never bullied, never picked on, never ridiculed. Even

21:19.640 --> 21:23.260
after being on hormones for 10 years, when the facial hair reached a

21:23.260 --> 21:29.060
certain point of removal, I suddenly am being perceived as female, no

21:29.060 --> 21:33.820
matter how I'm dressed. No ridicule, nothing. And you know, since then,

21:34.020 --> 21:39.580
I've, you know, I apparently pass because no one ever has ever confronted

21:39.580 --> 21:44.260
me about being trans, and it happens to my friends all the time. I feel

21:44.260 --> 21:48.360
guilty about it sometimes, you know. My name was always Dallas, so I didn't

21:48.360 --> 21:52.340
even have to change my name. So I just, I read in my facial hair and moved

21:52.340 --> 21:56.880
to Atlanta. I resigned my job. I worked as a psychological examiner in

21:56.880 --> 21:59.920
Tennessee. Tennessee was one of the few states with a master's level

21:59.920 --> 22:04.400
psychology licensure, so I was licensed. And I moved to Georgia and

22:04.400 --> 22:09.040
immediately got the same job. I was running the Montgomery Institute and

22:09.040 --> 22:12.860
living in their house for the first six months or so in exchange for

22:12.860 --> 22:16.840
cooking supper and doing some light cleaning. So I mean, I knew I had some

22:16.840 --> 22:21.180
safety net and making a little bit of money doing interviews for them. They

22:21.180 --> 22:24.640
said, if you do interviews, we'll give you $75 for every person you

22:24.640 --> 22:31.520
interview for the group. So anyway, so I got a job immediately and went to

22:31.520 --> 22:36.560
work. I moved in the middle of December. I waited until the first of the

22:36.560 --> 22:41.920
year to put in an application and I got my, I started my job on February

22:41.920 --> 22:48.160
10th, I think, 1990. And I worked doing the same thing I did in Tennessee.

22:48.460 --> 22:53.140
I was never certain I'd have a professional position again, but I got it.

22:54.060 --> 23:00.540
And I worked till I retired at age 60. I was 39 when I got the job, I'm

23:00.540 --> 23:07.220
maybe 40. And eventually my issues with the Montgomery is they were not,

23:07.380 --> 23:13.600
they were not happy about my ideas about transsexualism because it varied

23:13.600 --> 23:18.680
from the arson. I eventually broke from them. And when they told me I could

23:18.680 --> 23:22.540
no longer come to their support group because I threatened them, you know,

23:22.680 --> 23:26.340
that was not threatening them. I was just threatening to them because of

23:26.340 --> 23:32.040
what I believed. I started a support group in Atlanta called Atlanta Gender

23:32.040 --> 23:38.460
Explorations, which ran until last year. And I started a nonprofit called

23:38.460 --> 23:42.800
the Atlanta Educational Gender Information Service within six months. It

23:42.800 --> 23:47.540
had become the American Educational Gender Information Service. Scott 501c3

23:47.540 --> 23:50.940
status launched a journal called Chrysalis, which was a theme-based

23:50.940 --> 23:58.560
magazine, which was visually quite, it was laid out by Margo Schaefer,

23:58.700 --> 24:05.820
who's a graphic artist. So it was, it had a level of sophistication and

24:05.820 --> 24:12.900
appearance and idea, say, writing that went beyond mimeographed or dot

24:12.900 --> 24:19.120
matrix printed newsletters and had a huge effect getting attention from

24:19.120 --> 24:25.500
professionals. And, you know, the mission was for transsexual people, and I

24:25.500 --> 24:30.480
later changed that to transgender people to be treated with respect. And my

24:30.480 --> 24:33.860
whole, my whole shtick and all my activism has been for people to have

24:33.860 --> 24:37.940
enough information to make sensible decisions about their life because I

24:37.940 --> 24:42.680
certainly didn't have any. And one of the things I did, and I've got a book

24:42.680 --> 24:52.500
in production about it now, is my time at Tri-S. And I continued it after

24:52.500 --> 24:56.680
my transition because it was a wonderful chapter leader there called Linda

24:56.680 --> 25:01.540
Peacock, who despite her name was cisgender, she was a wife of a cross

25:01.540 --> 25:07.100
dresser. But it was essentially an open group. So any gender person in town

25:07.100 --> 25:12.620
could come by their, their meetings were in Atlanta and they lasted all

25:12.620 --> 25:16.460
weekend long. So it was like a little mini gender conference every year

25:16.460 --> 25:22.980
until Tri-S got mad and put in a new leader who was transphobic. And, but

25:22.980 --> 25:28.760
my time at Tri-S realized, number one, many of these people are not what

25:28.760 --> 25:32.900
you would think of as cross dressers. They were seriously trans. And a lot

25:32.900 --> 25:36.860
of the people that I know from those days have transitioned probably at

25:36.860 --> 25:44.020
least half of them. The other half would probably like to and just kind of

25:44.020 --> 25:48.820
didn't. And I realized there was a lot of sex going on and a lot of

25:48.820 --> 25:52.380
rationalization about it. You know, it's like, well, I think of you as a

25:52.380 --> 25:59.320
woman. So this is not male on male sex. This is a man and a woman. And not

25:59.320 --> 26:04.240
according to the CDC, it's, you know, it's male on male. And certainly in

26:04.240 --> 26:09.320
terms of logical risk of transmission of HIV, which was an issue at the

26:09.320 --> 26:16.180
time, it's the same as if you were a gay man. So hypocrisy there. Hypocrisy

26:16.180 --> 26:21.680
and there was a lot of hypocrisy around the wives. Because, you know, and

26:21.680 --> 26:27.460
I, I sense that at that very first in the 1970s meeting, our TV program

26:27.460 --> 26:31.200
where I saw them, is like, you know, we're all heterosexual, we're all just

26:31.200 --> 26:34.620
cross dressers, none of us want to be women. And I realized, and most of

26:34.620 --> 26:39.520
you do want to be women. And there's a lot of sex going on. And the whole

26:39.520 --> 26:48.260
structure is really designed to snow the cisgender wives, you know, to

26:48.260 --> 26:52.680
reassure them that, you know, and so there's a lot of selfishness there, I

26:52.680 --> 26:58.000
thought, and a lot of focus on the cross dressers at the expense of the

26:58.000 --> 27:02.160
wives. And I, identifying as a woman, I took great defense of that. So I

27:02.160 --> 27:07.260
made it one of my causes to really try to work from, to work with the

27:07.260 --> 27:12.860
leaders to change, you know, I point out, you know, you can be a male and

27:12.860 --> 27:18.900
being national organization for women, you know, you can be a Christian and

27:18.900 --> 27:23.200
be in any Jewish organization you want. You can be an NAACP if you're

27:23.200 --> 27:27.900
white. And you can have anyone, you can have open membership and try us and

27:27.900 --> 27:32.020
keep your focus on heterosexual cross dressing. And the final piece of a

27:32.020 --> 27:37.000
prophecy was, Virginia herself had been living as a woman for 20 or 30

27:37.000 --> 27:42.920
years at that point. The chapter leader that replaced Linda Peacock and

27:42.920 --> 27:46.260
cracked down on kicking and kicked all the transsexuals out of the group,

27:46.980 --> 27:50.980
lived full time as a woman. And I'm, you know, and I'm like, okay, what's

27:50.980 --> 27:53.640
the difference in me in Virginia Prince? Well, you have this certain

27:53.640 --> 27:58.820
special part, spark, you know, that we heterosexual cross dresses are lived

27:58.820 --> 28:02.660
full time don't have. And I'm like, I know bullshit when I hear it, you

28:02.660 --> 28:09.140
know. And so I worked very politely with them to just constantly nudge them

28:09.140 --> 28:15.560
until the national leader, Jane Ellen Fairfax, wrote that I was supportive

28:15.560 --> 28:20.800
of their membership, you know, and then I really ramped up with them. So I

28:20.800 --> 28:28.740
found myself in 1995 at Fantasia Fair, which is an annual trans conference

28:28.740 --> 28:32.640
that will have its 50th anniversary next year, held in Provincetown,

28:33.460 --> 28:39.640
Massachusetts on Cape Cod, the last second half of October and every year.

28:42.500 --> 28:46.420
I found myself assigned to be Virginia Prince's roommate. This is the very

28:46.420 --> 28:49.820
person that kept me out of the community for 10 years. And I knew that

28:49.820 --> 28:54.080
before I went, but it was like, okay, I get a free room. I'll room with

28:54.080 --> 28:58.780
anybody, you know. Dallas, will you tell us a little bit about who Virginia

28:58.780 --> 29:03.880
Prince is just for talking? Virginia Prince started the organization. Well,

29:03.920 --> 29:09.060
she co-founded it. She was a very early organizer for heterosexual cross

29:09.060 --> 29:13.460
dressing and to her inner defense, this was a time when almost no one

29:13.460 --> 29:17.040
believed including cross dressers themselves that it was possible to be

29:17.040 --> 29:23.740
straight and want to dress as a woman or want to be a woman. And that was

29:23.740 --> 29:27.900
her mission. And it was a good mission, but the way she chose to enforce it

29:27.900 --> 29:33.180
was by excluding gay cross dressers and transsexuals from her groups, which

29:33.180 --> 29:38.820
led to all the hypocrisy that I just talked about. And essentially

29:38.820 --> 29:46.020
fractionated the community and stopped it from growing, except unless you

29:46.020 --> 29:49.420
were in her organizations, because, you know, there was very little outside

29:49.420 --> 29:53.540
of that, almost no open groups, almost no transsexual groups, they were

29:53.540 --> 30:04.100
small. And she had a very, she was born in 1912, I think, she died early in

30:04.100 --> 30:11.360
the century at age 96. She was, she had a very autocratic leadership style

30:11.360 --> 30:15.120
and she alienated a lot of people. There were groups started in opposition

30:15.120 --> 30:20.900
to her membership policies and magazines launched in opposition to her. And

30:20.900 --> 30:26.900
so, but, but mostly, there was no communication between people who

30:26.900 --> 30:32.800
identified as transsexual people who identified as gay and cross dressed,

30:33.120 --> 30:37.120
and people identified as heterosexual and cross dressed, there was just no,

30:37.760 --> 30:43.240
no cross communication until the mid 80s, when the International Foundation

30:43.240 --> 30:46.520
for Gender Education started having national conferences, and suddenly

30:46.520 --> 30:50.640
we're all talking. You know, and a big issue at the time was, do we have

30:50.640 --> 30:54.700
anything in common with gay people? And I'm like, Oh, of course. You know,

30:54.840 --> 31:00.260
most gay and gay men and lesbians that get targeted are targeted because of

31:00.260 --> 31:05.100
their gender presentation and not because of their sexual orientation. You

31:05.100 --> 31:10.040
know, they, they look different to whoever is the, the bashers the haters

31:10.040 --> 31:10.480
are.

31:13.220 --> 31:23.140
So, so, Virginia was a very, people either loved her or hated her, you

31:23.140 --> 31:26.600
know, the cross dressers considered her the godmother of heterosexual cross

31:26.600 --> 31:29.940
dresses and almost every trans I was just speaking with Chelsea God,

31:30.580 --> 31:33.120
Goodwin this morning, who hates her?

31:36.320 --> 31:44.680
I have mixed feelings about her and I'll tell you why. And that is, she was

31:44.680 --> 31:48.580
not a brief candle, she made this her lifelong work, she did it often to

31:48.580 --> 31:57.460
her financial disadvantage. But mostly because in

31:57.460 --> 32:02.880
the 1970s and 60s, you know, after McCarthy era, then post office

32:02.880 --> 32:08.980
considered it its duty to rid the United States of homosexuality was legal

32:09.540 --> 32:14.000
to not only send pornographic material, but to have any kind of homoerotic

32:14.000 --> 32:21.520
correspondence. So, Virginia got at her place of business with she own, it

32:21.520 --> 32:26.320
was her company, she was chemist. Postal inspectors come and talk to her,

32:26.400 --> 32:31.880
she explains things and they, she thinks it's all over until postal

32:31.880 --> 32:35.320
inspectors come back with the police and arrest her. She's charged with a

32:35.320 --> 32:41.900
felony. Without knowing any better, she pleads guilty. So, now she's facing

32:41.900 --> 32:46.040
sentencing and they tell her that if she will stop publishing, she

32:46.040 --> 32:51.660
published, she launched a magazine transvestia in the 60s and that was the

32:51.660 --> 32:55.320
lifeline for all these cross dressers and out of that grew the cross

32:55.320 --> 33:00.620
dressing community. If she will stop publishing transvestia and close the

33:00.620 --> 33:04.440
mailbox that she ran because back then everyone had code names because they

33:04.440 --> 33:07.600
were afraid everyone had mailboxes and they were afraid to get any kind of

33:07.600 --> 33:11.560
mail because realistically, you know, they couldn't get mail at home, it

33:11.560 --> 33:17.180
might ruin their lives, you know. And their families lose their children,

33:17.440 --> 33:23.180
lose their jobs, lose their standing in the community. And they told her

33:23.180 --> 33:26.240
she would close that box that they corresponded with one another, through

33:26.240 --> 33:31.660
and close the magazine, they would drop charges or not prosecute her. And

33:31.660 --> 33:36.280
she refused and I'm like, how many people facing time in a penitentiary

33:36.280 --> 33:41.160
would take that hit? And she didn't go to, she didn't go to the

33:41.160 --> 33:45.780
penitentiary, but it wasn't, she thought she was going. And so I have to

33:45.780 --> 33:50.760
admire and respect her for her loyalty to her constituency. It's just her

33:50.760 --> 33:55.560
views that were screwed up. And her personality that made it difficult or

33:55.560 --> 34:02.900
impossible for her to revise those. So I kind of test her in most ways and

34:02.900 --> 34:08.400
admire her for her courage and dedication, if that makes any sense. Oh, no,

34:08.420 --> 34:11.180
that's absolutely perfect. And I love this context because you were just

34:11.180 --> 34:14.420
about to tell us you wound up rooming with her at Fantasia the first time.

34:14.480 --> 34:18.320
I did and I knew so I borrowed my friend's digital audio tape recorder, my

34:18.320 --> 34:27.340
roommates, and I spent the week interviewing her. And I sent this one off

34:27.340 --> 34:31.900
to Michigan in 2000 and I asked for a copy of the tapes because they were

34:31.900 --> 34:38.680
digital. So Julie, the curator there at Michigan, sent me a copy of the

34:38.680 --> 34:44.780
tapes, which I had not listened to since 1995. This is about 2015. It's

34:44.780 --> 34:49.460
2016 maybe. And I transcribed them and it gets like 180 pages double space.

34:49.860 --> 34:54.400
It was a big job. And I have an arrangement with Margot Wilson of

34:54.400 --> 35:00.140
Transgender Publishing to do a book centered around the transcript.

35:01.080 --> 35:04.420
In my personal writings about Virginia over the year, I have an article

35:04.420 --> 35:09.040
called The Trius Wars talking about my attempts to get them to change. And

35:09.040 --> 35:13.840
an article that I published called First Contact about how that letter

35:13.840 --> 35:18.620
exchange with Virginia. And I'm trying to make a balanced book and it's

35:18.620 --> 35:23.860
coming along really well. I've been plugging away at that. I've been

35:23.860 --> 35:28.400
interviewing Ariadne Kane, who was the principal person behind. I've been a

35:28.400 --> 35:33.460
dozen times probably to Albany to interview Ari and it's going to be three

35:33.460 --> 35:38.220
times as much to transcribe. I'm looking at some automatic transcription

35:38.220 --> 35:44.180
software now. Ari is another interesting character in the trans community

35:44.180 --> 35:50.340
and sometimes divisive. But both Virginia and Ari were very productive

35:50.340 --> 35:58.940
people and throughout their lives. I proposed in 2000, I proposed to the

35:58.940 --> 36:03.300
board with an organization that was running Fantasia Fair, which I happened

36:03.300 --> 36:07.960
to be chair of at the time, I think. I proposed an award called the

36:08.960 --> 36:12.940
Transgender Pioneer Award and it was specifically for people who have given

36:12.940 --> 36:17.460
unstintingly of their time, energy, and often sacrificed money in their

36:17.460 --> 36:23.880
careers in pursuit of making things better for other trans people. And it's

36:23.880 --> 36:27.620
been going on for 20 years now. Jude Patton and Rupert Raj,

36:37.940 --> 36:41.020
who were and I really appreciate that too because when you were talking

36:41.020 --> 36:47.280
about the Montgomery Clinic, you said that was also started by a trans man,

36:47.440 --> 36:56.340
right? They both did, yeah. Jerry, I don't even know what his name prior to

36:56.340 --> 37:01.080
transition was, but prior to transition, Jerry was a professor at some

37:01.080 --> 37:06.540
women's college over near Avondale. What's that called?

37:11.160 --> 37:17.540
So women's near Avondale. Agnes Scott. Agnes Scott, yeah. He was a

37:17.540 --> 37:20.480
professor there and he lost his job when he transitioned. I guess he went

37:20.480 --> 37:26.420
to the gender clinic where he met Lynn. So they had been working with trans

37:26.420 --> 37:33.720
women and trans men both, but mostly trans women for or a decade maybe by

37:33.720 --> 37:38.680
the time I found them. And Lynn had, Jerry had had three heart attacks.

37:38.920 --> 37:44.660
This was not in good health. And Lynn had chronic fatigue syndrome, which

37:44.660 --> 37:49.220
was newly recognized. And I think she was getting a little organic because

37:49.220 --> 37:53.780
she was not quite rational at times, I think because of brain damage from

37:53.780 --> 37:59.300
her, her condition eventually killed her. I'm Jerry Died only recently. He

37:59.300 --> 38:07.380
ended up somehow in Oregon or Washington state. But that organization

38:07.380 --> 38:11.520
stopped maybe

38:11.520 --> 38:21.500
around 95. They decided I was their enemy, I guess because of the way I

38:21.500 --> 38:26.200
thought. And I decided, well, I can be their enemy, they're not going to be

38:26.200 --> 38:29.440
my enemy because we're both in the business of helping people and I'm not

38:29.440 --> 38:34.820
going to attack them. But I did make sure that every time I wrote a booklet

38:34.820 --> 38:39.520
or a flyer or published an issue at Chrysalis that I'd mailed him a copy

38:39.520 --> 38:43.420
because I knew it had to hurt. That's as far as I went towards any

38:43.420 --> 38:49.460
retribution to Jerry actually calm my place of employment and outed me. And

38:49.460 --> 38:53.940
I think because he believed I was harming people because I was not like a

38:53.940 --> 38:59.720
totally non, a totally binary system person. You know, I was questioning

38:59.720 --> 39:07.180
the binary in ways that were difficult because binary wasn't even really a

39:07.180 --> 39:11.500
concept. So we didn't even know what we were questioning. Holly Boswell was

39:11.500 --> 39:15.960
a big part of that. I published her article, the transgender alternative in

39:15.960 --> 39:19.260
Chrysalis, which also came out about the same time in tapestry. And that

39:19.260 --> 39:23.520
was the first time. Anne Boleyn is an anthropologist and she did a study in

39:23.520 --> 39:25.600
the late 80s in a trans group in Colorado.

39:28.580 --> 39:33.680
And everyone had to identify, she called them career paths, it just be an

39:33.680 --> 39:37.320
anthropological term, but you had to, you were sort of called upon to

39:37.320 --> 39:45.780
identify as transsexual, across-dresser, or gay and a drag queen. And that

39:45.780 --> 39:51.180
was not only externally policed, it was internally policed. If you were a

39:51.180 --> 39:53.960
cross-dresser and you thought maybe you wanted to take hormones, it's like,

39:54.020 --> 39:58.240
oh, horrors. And one of my friends was kicked out of her transsexual

39:58.240 --> 40:02.400
support group for not moving fast enough towards transition. And it didn't

40:02.400 --> 40:06.580
matter that she was poor as a church mouse and couldn't afford therapy to

40:06.580 --> 40:07.680
get on hormones.

40:11.100 --> 40:15.760
And I mean, I realized that I messed up that was and Holly's Boswell broke

40:15.760 --> 40:22.460
us out of that binary. And in a large extent, the many people that were

40:22.460 --> 40:27.460
questioning the binary in a multitude of ways in the early 90s led us to

40:27.460 --> 40:31.100
the freedom we have now to be whoever we want to be or feel we need to be

40:31.100 --> 40:38.380
or are. And that's a gratifying thing. But it didn't really happen until

40:38.380 --> 40:42.840
cross-dressers and transsexuals and drag queens were all talking. And they

40:42.840 --> 40:45.320
had some place where they could come to get it physically to meet because

40:45.320 --> 40:51.280
there was no internet. It was all like, we were looking for terms and we

40:51.280 --> 40:54.220
were proposing them in newsletters, so there would be like 20 newsletters

40:54.220 --> 40:58.600
in which this conversation is taking place. And all kinds of terms were

40:58.600 --> 41:04.580
popped out. Virginia Prince suggested, what did she possess?

41:08.080 --> 41:14.780
Bi-gendered until some wag, Tara Fredrickson, it was moved hyphen over and

41:14.780 --> 41:18.700
made it big-endered. And that sort of was the end of that. And transgender

41:18.700 --> 41:24.100
kind of arose out of that in terms of one really consensus, but it was

41:24.100 --> 41:28.000
being discussed. And then suddenly started appearing in the media mostly

41:28.000 --> 41:32.660
around, I noticed, around the march on Washington where they were excluding

41:32.660 --> 41:37.200
trans people. And all the gay press were suddenly saying transgender and we

41:37.200 --> 41:41.680
were saying it and Holly was saying it and Southern Comfort was saying it.

41:41.960 --> 41:47.580
And suddenly that became our umbrella and eventually our identity. When

41:47.580 --> 41:51.580
you're talking about the different newsletters that were coming out, what

41:51.580 --> 41:55.820
do you consider the major newsletters that were in conversation with each

41:55.820 --> 42:01.220
other at the time? Well, there were a number of magazines. One was

42:01.220 --> 42:05.720
Tapestry, which was called TVTS Tapestry. Eventually became transgender

42:05.720 --> 42:09.440
tapestry. I edited it for the better part of 10 years in the early part of

42:09.440 --> 42:14.840
the century. Chrisless, which was a theme-based magazine that had maybe 15

42:14.840 --> 42:22.580
issues, but it was highly influential. Some of the newsletters were kind of

42:22.580 --> 42:25.940
folksy, but then some of them were really tracking the news like the

42:25.940 --> 42:31.040
Renaissance Education Association in Pennsylvania. They had chapters around

42:31.040 --> 42:36.700
that area. Some of them out of state in New Jersey, I think, but they were

42:36.700 --> 42:41.820
tracking all the news when Nancy Berkholder gets kicked out of the Michigan

42:41.820 --> 42:49.180
Women's Music Festival. They put that news in their newsletter and other

42:49.180 --> 42:54.640
things. And so there's a big conversation and people could actually meet

42:54.640 --> 42:58.940
one another at the IFG conference, the Be All, Southern Comfort, and other

42:58.940 --> 43:03.260
trans conferences. And everyone's welcome suddenly. It's not just you can't

43:03.260 --> 43:07.160
come because you're transsexual identified or you can't come. And

43:07.760 --> 43:11.480
transsexuals would exclude cross dressers too. So it was just a mutual,

43:19.980 --> 43:23.080
I don't want to say a bad and I'm glad that changed. And when it did

43:23.080 --> 43:29.520
change, that led us to where we are today. I'm convinced. Yeah. So you,

43:29.920 --> 43:33.280
yes, absolutely, right? These changes in language are so important. And I

43:33.280 --> 43:37.180
think that when you're talking about tapestry, you were there for quite a

43:37.180 --> 43:43.320
long time. So can you tell me about what that experience was like? IFGE was

43:43.320 --> 43:48.800
started at Fantasia Fair. The idea came up. Marissa Cheryl Lynn, I think,

43:48.880 --> 43:55.980
initially proposed it. And she split off from a group she started called

43:55.980 --> 44:01.700
Tiffany Club. They had a house in Boston. I read an article about it

44:01.700 --> 44:06.740
recently where people come and call from a phone booth, and they would get

44:06.740 --> 44:10.220
a visual inspection to see if they were okay to actually bring them into

44:10.220 --> 44:15.720
the house. But she split that off and founded the International Foundation

44:15.720 --> 44:20.600
for Gender Education. And when I, when I started Aegis, it was, they had an

44:20.600 --> 44:27.860
actual office only trans organization that did in Boston suburbs. And in a

44:27.860 --> 44:32.400
magazine with a significant, you know, it was glossy. Everyone else was,

44:32.540 --> 44:37.000
like I said, using dot matrix printers and they had a glossy magazine. It

44:37.000 --> 44:42.900
was square bound at the time. And, but I just always felt that they, they,

44:42.900 --> 44:49.820
they lacked a queer sensibility. They were kind of, kind of heterocentric

44:49.820 --> 44:54.560
in a lot of the things they did and severely underproductive. I was

44:54.560 --> 45:00.500
concerned, considering they're a relatively large amount of funding, they

45:00.500 --> 45:03.640
were knocking down about a quarter of a million dollars a year in the mid

45:03.640 --> 45:09.220
90s when Aegis was making 25,000 FTM International was bringing in about

45:09.220 --> 45:15.060
$25,000. And, and most of the other organizations were about at the same

45:15.060 --> 45:21.280
rate. And, you know, and much of the gender education came out of those $25

45:21.280 --> 45:26.820
,000 organizations and not as much as should out of IFGE. And they

45:26.820 --> 45:30.800
considered Aegis a competitor. And I'm like, how can you compete when

45:30.800 --> 45:39.340
you're helping people? But, you know, so I, they gave me their Trinity

45:39.340 --> 45:45.140
award in the mid 90s. And they had this lifetime achievement award that

45:45.140 --> 45:50.580
they named after Virginia Prince. And I'm like, all the people to name it

45:50.580 --> 45:57.680
after. And I kept refusing it. So by the second half of the 90s, they were

45:57.680 --> 46:02.200
trying to give me and I'm like, well, number one is I'm only in my late 40s

46:02.200 --> 46:07.360
now, you know, so my lifetime is not up yet. And I refused it. And finally,

46:07.520 --> 46:13.060
Yvonne Cook Riley, who's now living in Asheville, says, okay, you just let

46:13.060 --> 46:16.700
I'm tired of calling you every year to ask if you will accept it. So you

46:16.700 --> 46:20.540
just let me know when you're ready. And one year I've been, okay, I'm

46:20.540 --> 46:23.860
ready. I call her and tell her and they gave me the award. And I was the

46:23.860 --> 46:27.600
last person to get the award. Yeah, if she dissolved right after that.

46:30.420 --> 46:35.000
The time I got the award, but also glad I didn't get the award until I got

46:35.000 --> 46:39.460
the award, you know, because I'm like, I was wanting to signify to them

46:39.460 --> 46:44.020
that they needed to straighten up their act. You know, I appreciate that.

46:44.260 --> 46:46.700
Well, and this is something that it seems like you've done consistently,

46:47.040 --> 46:51.800
right, like trying to transform within organizations. So when you started

46:51.800 --> 46:56.220
your organization, can you tell us a little bit about it and what you did

46:56.220 --> 47:01.080
intentionally differently, like, to foster? Well, first, when I started an

47:01.080 --> 47:04.940
organization and the reason I started Atlanta Gender Exploration Support

47:04.940 --> 47:09.080
Group was because I was no longer welcome at the only transsexual support

47:09.080 --> 47:16.880
group I knew. There were only a few open groups in the United States. The

47:16.880 --> 47:19.960
closest was in Asheville, North Carolina, which was the Phoenix group

47:19.960 --> 47:25.680
started by Holly Boswell. That's a long drive from Atlanta. So I started a

47:25.680 --> 47:31.600
group and it was an open group. And anyone who wanted to come, we had, you

47:31.600 --> 47:35.700
know, intersex people, we had transsexual identified people, cross

47:35.700 --> 47:42.560
dressers, gay people. And I was very proud of that group. We was

47:42.560 --> 47:46.540
professionally, at least for the first 10 years or more, was professionally

47:46.540 --> 47:50.820
facilitated. I did a little bit, but mostly we had license because I wasn't

47:50.820 --> 47:56.280
licensed in Georgia because Georgia didn't have a master's level licensure

47:56.280 --> 48:01.560
for psychology. So we had licensed people leading the groups to keep it

48:01.560 --> 48:07.960
from going sideways, you know, which could happen. So I found, I found it

48:07.960 --> 48:12.460
easiest because I wanted just to get information to people like me who had

48:12.460 --> 48:16.820
no information so they could make competent decisions about their lives,

48:17.300 --> 48:20.860
you know, fact-based decisions about their lives. Because oftentimes

48:20.860 --> 48:26.960
transsexuals would get so frustrated by lack of information that they would

48:26.960 --> 48:31.880
just get to the point of desperation. Many people killed themselves. Many

48:31.880 --> 48:37.120
of them had kind of disaster reveals, you know, many of them did things out

48:37.120 --> 48:41.840
of, out of desperation that really fouled up their lives. And if they had

48:41.840 --> 48:45.060
more information, they could have had a more reasoned approach to whatever

48:45.060 --> 48:51.380
they decided to do. So, and it became quickly clear and I launched

48:51.380 --> 48:55.380
Chrysalis at the same time that it was a national need and not just an

48:55.380 --> 49:00.420
Atlanta need. So I changed the name and I'd chosen the acronym Aegis so I

49:00.420 --> 49:07.580
could do that. So Atlanta became American, you know, we got 501C3 status.

49:08.060 --> 49:14.900
We were presenting at conferences. We published like self-help books and

49:14.900 --> 49:24.080
worked with WPATH, which was then Habigda, the Harry Benjamin International

49:24.080 --> 49:26.160
Gender Dysphoria Association.

49:28.400 --> 49:33.100
And so, yeah, I guess I worked within and the reason I did was because I

49:33.100 --> 49:36.900
thought I could have most impact there. If I'd not been able to work

49:36.900 --> 49:39.740
within, I would have definitely worked without, but I was never kind of

49:39.740 --> 49:44.460
like a go-to-protest activist.

49:44.740 --> 49:50.180
I was more like, let's just keep a pressure on people and not make them any

49:50.180 --> 49:54.080
angrier than we have to because if they get angry, they're going to resist

49:54.080 --> 50:01.620
more. But I mean, you know, I've been a cervic at times when I needed to,

50:01.680 --> 50:09.100
as I was with Tri-S. You know, when Jane Ellen Verfax told me that they

50:09.100 --> 50:14.340
were not gender-policed, that anyone who said they were heterosexual cross

50:14.340 --> 50:20.940
-dresser was a heterosexual cross-dresser. As far as they were concerned, I

50:20.940 --> 50:25.460
said, fine, I'm a heterosexual cross-dresser. I want full membership and

50:25.460 --> 50:31.100
they freaked out. I did an issue of Chrysalis called Hetero called the

50:31.100 --> 50:36.240
transgender gothic and had an article called Hetero-Pocrisy about the

50:36.240 --> 50:40.400
hypocrisy in the organization and they freaked out and asked for the board

50:40.400 --> 50:45.000
chair for me to be, for me to be disciplined and they said, for what? She

50:45.000 --> 50:49.400
was just quoting your own statistics at you, you know, because I was, I

50:49.400 --> 50:52.680
cited one of their chapters which showed that half of the members were on

50:52.680 --> 50:57.000
hormones, you know, and it's hard to argue with that. It's hard to

50:57.000 --> 51:04.160
discipline me for that. I was really proud of our board chair. So I can be

51:04.160 --> 51:08.940
thorny. I remember I did a direct action at Pride one year. I went up to

51:08.940 --> 51:16.800
PFLAG with a flyer that was provided by Transsexual Menace, which was an

51:16.800 --> 51:21.640
early activist organization, and I asked them what their, what their

51:21.640 --> 51:26.220
position was towards trans people and they were all running around like

51:26.220 --> 51:30.420
chickens with their heads cut off, but they discussed it. Within about

51:30.420 --> 51:34.540
three months they were a trans positive chapter and that happened in a lot

51:34.540 --> 51:40.580
of cities and so PFLAG was one of the first LGB organizations to really

51:40.580 --> 51:46.020
sincerely add the T as opposed to like HRC, which never really, which

51:46.020 --> 51:50.740
resisted and then only kind of did and worked behind our backs to get us

51:50.740 --> 51:56.300
out of enda. Do you remember what year that was that you were, where you

51:56.300 --> 52:01.100
fly your PFLAG? It would have been about 93 or 94 maybe. Okay, that makes

52:01.100 --> 52:04.920
sense. And then, so they invited me to talk and I went and talked to their

52:04.920 --> 52:08.760
group the next month, so that was, that was nice. And I've been very proud

52:08.760 --> 52:13.860
of that organization ever since. Absolutely. Well, and since we're talking

52:13.860 --> 52:17.260
about this like period of the late 80s, early 90s, we've been talking about

52:17.260 --> 52:22.840
activism. What was the social scene like in Atlanta at the time? Well, in

52:22.840 --> 52:26.380
Nashville, it was interesting, I would go out in public in Nashville from

52:26.380 --> 52:33.840
age 15 and 60s, mid 60s. And I couldn't get in any of the gay bars because

52:33.840 --> 52:38.000
my ID said male and they wouldn't let anyone cross dressed in the bars.

52:42.700 --> 52:46.220
And I didn't want to go if I wasn't cross dressed, I had no reason to go if

52:46.220 --> 52:53.480
I wasn't cross dressed. And if I had, I think sometimes we all do, what if

52:53.480 --> 52:56.080
things had been a little different? What if they'd let me in the bars? I

52:56.080 --> 52:59.720
would have, sure I was, I was young and pretty, I would have been adopted

52:59.720 --> 53:04.580
by the drag queens and had, you've been a drag daughter to somebody, but

53:04.580 --> 53:09.860
they, I couldn't get in. So, Knoxville had a drag club when I was in

53:09.860 --> 53:16.980
graduate school, it wasn't very good. I moved to Atlanta and there's a real

53:16.980 --> 53:21.740
big drag scene going on and there was a place next to the terror theater

53:23.260 --> 53:27.940
called, at various times, Lipsticks and LaVita, but they had like this

53:27.940 --> 53:33.300
fabulous drag show with production numbers, there's your kitty, with

53:33.300 --> 53:38.980
production numbers. And I

53:38.980 --> 53:42.960
love going there. I'm convinced I met Yersey Kaczynski there one night.

53:43.780 --> 53:47.700
There was someone that looked an awful lot like him sitting there. And I

53:47.700 --> 53:51.760
had a little conversation with him, I wrote an article about Yersey who had

53:51.760 --> 53:55.860
this, transsexuals were in almost all of his books, he had this kind of,

53:55.860 --> 54:01.460
he'd sexualized transsexuals. Interesting fellow too, you know, he was

54:01.460 --> 54:09.100
supposed to be at on Rodeo Drive the night of the Sharon Tate murders and

54:09.100 --> 54:13.000
he wasn't there and, you know, like he was a shady character, an interest

54:13.000 --> 54:17.800
and somewhat of a fraud, literary fraud, it's believed. But I'm convinced

54:17.800 --> 54:22.660
it was him and maybe it wasn't, maybe it was just my imagination, but there

54:22.660 --> 54:27.160
were, they did like a phantom of the opera production, it was beautiful. A

54:27.160 --> 54:30.420
lot of their, some of their performers were clearly trans and some clearly

54:30.420 --> 54:37.520
weren't. And then there was a scene, there was, there was a trans woman and

54:37.520 --> 54:44.680
I'm trying to think of her name and she, she ran a Thai restaurant over on,

54:45.560 --> 54:54.020
it's a little mall over on Peach Street, on Piedmont, what's it called? I'm

54:54.020 --> 54:57.080
blanking, I'm old, I'm 73, I forget now and sometimes.

55:00.160 --> 55:06.280
You know, there was, I published a lot of articles in the gay press, I was

55:06.280 --> 55:12.180
always getting interviewed by the gay press. And I was really sad when

55:12.180 --> 55:21.020
LaVita's closed, now I missed out by only a few years on Sweet Gumhead and

55:21.020 --> 55:25.680
some of the other older traditional bars. I remember walking by when I was

55:25.680 --> 55:29.680
in visiting Atlanta with a friend and seeing the street flyers outside of

55:29.680 --> 55:33.980
the one bar on Peach Street, where they call all the performers Mr, you

55:33.980 --> 55:43.360
know, like Mr, Mr. June Singer, you know, to make up a name. But so I never

55:43.360 --> 55:48.300
got any of those, one of my friends, we go to one of those clubs where

55:48.300 --> 55:54.920
RuPaul was a waiter. And, but I miss, I missed that scene a little bit, but

55:54.920 --> 55:59.220
the first few years I went quite a bit to the gay bars, I was on the like

55:59.220 --> 56:02.940
the a gay list for a while, going to, you know, through a set or a

56:02.940 --> 56:07.560
magazine, I was getting invited to all kinds of things. Some, some, some

56:07.560 --> 56:14.960
fellow's house and he had a full pipe organ in his living room. And he

56:14.960 --> 56:18.740
played it and it was fabulous, you know, it was the Christmas party. I was

56:18.740 --> 56:25.220
on advisory board for the same reason for the mayor, Bill Campbell, who I

56:25.220 --> 56:28.160
really liked but turned out to be a crook went to jail.

56:31.080 --> 56:35.740
Those are some amazing stories. I really appreciate that. When you're

56:35.740 --> 56:43.100
talking about the distinction to between like drag and trans clearly you

56:43.100 --> 56:47.160
experience that early when you're a Nashville, what was, was their

56:47.160 --> 56:52.080
attention? How did you navigate that tension? Like growing up, coming into

56:52.080 --> 56:58.220
your identity, etc. I didn't, when I went to high school, it was one person

56:58.220 --> 57:02.000
who was known to be gay and he was a big farmer dude in overalls and he

57:02.000 --> 57:08.180
pinched boys. And I remember he pinched me in English class and I turned

57:08.180 --> 57:11.140
around and told him if he hit me again, I was going to knock his effing

57:11.140 --> 57:17.060
head off. Because that's what I was supposed to say. There was a gay

57:17.060 --> 57:22.720
teacher and everyone knew he was gay because he was quite feminine and but

57:24.040 --> 57:27.500
I don't really like them. He was an English teacher in 11th grade, but

57:27.500 --> 57:31.420
that's not only gay people I had any. There was one boy and he always

57:31.420 --> 57:34.940
carried his books like this and I wanted to talk to him but he was always

57:34.940 --> 57:39.100
surrounded by a posse of girls who would just make over him and I could

57:39.100 --> 57:40.280
never catch him alone.

57:43.680 --> 57:51.800
So I just went out as a girl to the department stores and to the movies and

57:51.800 --> 57:59.660
to eat and ride the city buses around and everyone took me for female and

57:59.660 --> 58:05.840
men were hitting on me all the time and occasionally I would let myself get

58:05.840 --> 58:13.120
caught. And it was very scary because they didn't know and confusing

58:13.120 --> 58:19.520
because I was still trying to figure myself out. But the gay bars, a lot of

58:19.520 --> 58:25.180
gay bars burned in those days. One of my friends and one of my fellow

58:25.180 --> 58:30.880
students in a class I took in college was a fireman in Nashville and there

58:30.880 --> 58:34.840
was a place called the Haddoncote Saloon that burned and people burned to

58:34.840 --> 58:38.900
death there and were jumping out of windows on fire, things like that. It

58:38.900 --> 58:43.860
was probably arson. There were a lot of arson related gay bar burnings. But

58:43.860 --> 58:47.360
I never was in the scene because I went to the Haddoncote one time

58:47.360 --> 58:51.380
undressed and I saw women that I now know are trans because they were so

58:51.380 --> 58:54.480
beautiful and it wasn't an illusion. It was because they were really

58:54.480 --> 59:01.640
beautiful. I really love, we're Paul's taking a lot of flak from the trans

59:01.640 --> 59:07.460
community but his show is so transpositive, has been for the past few

59:07.460 --> 59:13.660
years. Last year one of the performers was obviously out in trans. Another

59:13.660 --> 59:18.080
one was like, breaks down on camera and says, oh you're everything I've

59:18.080 --> 59:22.540
ever wanted to be on trans and came out to themselves and out to publicly

59:22.540 --> 59:29.300
as trans and two other people did as a result of that. So like a third of

59:29.300 --> 59:35.760
the cast is now trans identified. So this distinction between drag queens

59:35.760 --> 59:44.820
and trans people has always been largely artificial and now it's hard to

59:44.820 --> 59:51.560
not recognize that largely because of RuPaul's show. And that's clearly

59:51.560 --> 59:59.740
another Atlanta connection, right RuPaul? RuPaul was here shortly before

59:59.740 --> 01:00:05.900
uni became famous, went to New York and suddenly was on Mac, Cosmetics,

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:11.700
National Ads. But he got a lot of flak from the community for using a rural

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:17.100
word, trans-y. But trans-y and trans-y were terms we used affectionately

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:22.700
with one another in the early 90s. So in fact, I was just talking to

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:29.060
Chelsea Godlin just before this meeting. Alexa thinks I'm called her name.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.000
I'm going to wait for Alexa to shut up.

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:47.100
Alexa stop. Okay. I have no idea what it said. Joys of technology. No, I

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:52.880
love it. You were talking about language like tranny and trans-y Yeah,

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:59.160
sexual. We were using it affectionately. It's also been used as a hate term

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:04.880
for us. But what has it? And when RuPaul got a lot of flak for using the

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:10.140
term and I'm convinced RuPaul did not use it in a hateful manner. But he

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:15.320
got a lot of flak on Facebook and Twitter. Twitter for that that I didn't

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.720
think he really deserved. Now, could he do more to help us? Absolutely. The

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:25.300
other thing I think that's become very manifest is that the whole issue of

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:32.080
shade in the drag community is like, no, drag queens aren't really mean

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:39.340
itchy, bitchy people. It is shtick that did you just, you know, and it's

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:42.220
really manifest from watching all those shows and I'm married to someone

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:48.280
who watches them all. Get on the VPN and we're in Sweden so we can watch

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:53.260
Drag Race Sweden and Drag Race Portugal and Drag Race Brazil and Drag Race

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:58.120
Spain and Drag Race France. Canada, England, Australia. We've seen them

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:05.680
all. Thailand. But it's really manifest what caring level people most of

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.860
them are and how much they care for their fellow performance. Even in a

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:14.820
very high stakes cutthroat competition, they're still kind and they still

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:18.960
cut their other performance, a lot of stats, flak and they cry when they

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:24.260
when they get washed out and leave. So yeah, we've paused on a lot of good.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:30.460
Yeah, absolutely. And visibility is something all the time, right? It is.

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:35.320
You know, I mean, in that early 90s community, there was a big lot of

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:40.780
homophobia. And it was this, you know, well, we don't have anything in

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:43.820
common with gay people. Well, we have everything in common with gay people.

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:49.340
And it's not even discussed anymore, so I'm really glad we got we got

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:54.360
passed that. Yeah, I want to go back to something, too, because as you were

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:58.420
telling this story, you said you started crossdressing in high school and

01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:02.460
then you like took the bus around town. So were you doing this all on your

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:08.980
own? Did your family know? My family knew after point because they found

01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:15.120
where I hid my clothes. I put them under a loose board in the attic. And

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:21.940
and they found me and my it was interesting because this was probably 15.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:30.200
They found them and they took me to a psychologist at the army at the Air

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:35.780
Force Base. We just moved to Smyrna, Tennessee. And it's just before they

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:40.260
because of the proximity to Seward Air Force Base, because my father was

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:45.100
retired from the military. And they took me to the psychologist who I

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:49.120
convinced it was just I was being so nonchalant about it, you know, like

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:52.840
it's just felt like doing it, you know, so he tells them it's not really

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:57.900
serious. But the second time they found the clothes, they take me to Walter

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:03.740
Reed Hospital for for a full medical workup, I guess, because they didn't

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:09.480
understand if I'm like this, maybe I must have some problems with my body,

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:16.060
you know. And I didn't, at least none that they identify. Built very small,

01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:21.160
but they didn't bother me, you know. But I guess they wondered something

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:25.940
might be wrong. And I guess they felt guilty, my parents. But my mother was

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:31.300
always after that, giving me the most masculine gifts she could think of

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:36.880
for Christmas, like old spice or a Brooks Brothers suit, or wingtip shoes.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:41.400
And I was always like a little knife going in me every year. And when I

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:45.840
transitioned, she told me not to come or call. Actually, before transition,

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:49.720
when I told her I was going to not to come or call, not to write, and I

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:54.820
didn't not for didn't see my parents whenever saw my father again, they can

01:04:54.820 --> 01:05:01.740
tell me he died until he was safely in the ground. That was hard. Bearable,

01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:07.920
but hard. That's so difficult. I'm so sorry to hear that. But it sounds

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:15.460
like you reconnected with your mother or no? I did. My sister Tanya was the

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:22.000
first to lose mom to tell us who we can see or not, you know. But my

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:28.360
brother told me, you know, pretty much the same thing, stay away. And, you

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.880
know, because he had kids and he was afraid I was going to be a bad

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:37.960
influence on him or something. And my other sister betrayed me because I

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:42.320
went to her when I was headed for transition to ask for her help. And she

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.340
torpedoed me. But my mother who orchestrated the whole thing in the first

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:52.840
place when my father died, around the turn of the century, lung and liver

01:05:52.840 --> 01:06:01.280
cancer, he was a lifelong smoker of unfiltered camels, his only vice. She

01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:06.680
calls me one morning. I've not been corresponding with my parents since

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:12.760
1989. And she calls me one morning and it wakes me and I'm talking there

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:16.540
before I realize it because honestly, if I'd been awake, I would just put

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:23.560
the phone back on the cradle, no cell phones in. And then, yeah, we'd go

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:29.620
see her after that until her death and maybe 2006, maybe it's 2007 when she

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:34.840
died. So, you know, and I'm grateful for that. But she was a frustrating

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:43.540
woman. It sounds like it. And it sounds like that also made your experience

01:06:43.540 --> 01:06:47.600
through high school and college really like a difficult connection to. Did

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:54.940
you maintain family connections through there? This was, I mean, so close

01:06:54.940 --> 01:07:06.540
got discovered maybe three times. And once I was probably out of high

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:11.080
school by then, but I contacted a beauty shop and asked to be made over.

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:17.780
And I made the mistake of lying and Selma was doing it for fraternity. And

01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:21.300
so they were a little freaked so they called the police and they made me

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:24.800
over. But the police came and the police were so nice to me because I just

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:29.940
look like a girl, you know, and they call my parents and my parents came

01:07:29.940 --> 01:07:35.280
and that's the only time I purged. I burned my clothes purely for reasons

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:39.460
of symbolism not because I wanted to or to test in myself, but because I

01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:43.680
thought I needed to send my family the sign. So everything I did was

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:50.580
clandestine. I would go out of the house and change in a gas station with

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:56.740
bathrooms or empty buildings in the college or when I got a little older, I

01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:01.080
would rent a room and I would go in the room and change and I would hotel

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:07.660
room my hotel room and I would be absolutely mortified at the idea of going

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:13.500
out not because I thought anyone would read me but because I thought

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:17.160
someone might see me going in as a guy and coming out as a girl and putting

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:23.160
two in two together. And then around right out of high school I was working

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:29.220
at Shoneys which is a big boy restaurant and I got kicked out of the house

01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:34.760
because of my attitude. I had my first car which I spent $30 for which was

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.400
a 1950 Dodge. And

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:47.360
I found this hotel called the Ross Art Hotel on Fifth in Commerce in

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:51.860
Nashville. That's where the big bat building stands now in Nashville and

01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:59.040
out the front door of the of the of the not got a room for $8 a week which

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:03.840
I could afford even making a dollar and a half an hour, you know. So out

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.740
the front door across the Cane Sloan parking lot was the back door of the

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:12.040
Ryman Auditorium where the Grand Ole Opry was held and the back door of

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:17.680
Tootsies and I could watch on weekends the country music stars who couldn't

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:23.500
be seen drinking going out between the two buildings. Out the back door was

01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:31.680
was Printers Alley which was all the nightclubs in in town. It was filled

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:35.360
with nightclubs. I don't know if all the nightclubs in town were there. One

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:38.800
block up the hill was Church Street with all three of the big department

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:44.660
stores, Woolworths, Movie Theater, the library. And one block down was

01:09:44.660 --> 01:09:51.020
Lower Broad with all the CD bars, CD country bars. And I would I would go

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:56.580
out, sneak out the back door of the Ross and it turns out I did some

01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:00.560
research when I was in Nashville last month and well because because I

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.180
never heard much about the Ross but apparently it and Merchants Hotel on

01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:08.140
Broadway where a whole lot of country stars landed when they first hit

01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:13.800
Nashville and had no money. So I was in good company I guess because I

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:17.580
write songs and sing. But

01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:24.920
I would like Jimmy did I would put a piece of paper in the door so it

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:28.900
wouldn't latch and eventually they they they realized that was happening

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:36.560
and so I got seen so the manager comes to the door of my room and knocked

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:42.120
and I'm all dressed and he looks at me and he says what are you doing here

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:45.380
and I'm like well I live here but no you're not there's no women in the

01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:47.780
Ross and I couldn't convince the military he says I'm going for the

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:52.560
manager. He comes back and I rip off all my clothes and scrub my face and

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:58.440
put on my I put on my boy clothes and pounding on the door a minute later

01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:03.280
and open the door and I'm like yeah where you on and they said where is she

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:07.200
I'm like well boy too and then we know you had a woman in the group you

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.220
know we're gonna have to kick you out of the Ross at that point I figured I

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.340
had nothing to lose so I tried to convince them that I was the woman and

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:18.820
they wouldn't believe me I wrote a play about that because it was so effing

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:19.500
ridiculous.

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.340
So I got kicked out fortunately my appearance took me back but I was there

01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:29.220
for about a year.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:41.160
I'm not hearing you. I love that. What was the name of the play you wrote?

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:46.300
Down and out at the Ross fireproof hotel because I had a big sign fireproof

01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:53.500
along the top. Brilliant that's so good. Okay before we move on to the next

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.640
question I need a short bio break I don't know if you need to stand up use

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.300
the restroom or get some water. Five minutes. Five minutes does that work

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:05.360
for you? Five minutes works for me. All right perfect thank you so much.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.260
Sure bye-bye.

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:16.980
We didn't ask me again to okay the recording I guess good. It's because

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:21.500
it's the same session so we'll come back we get to come back to it so thank

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:26.460
you so much for that short break. So now it's about 11 30 Pacific Standard

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:31.280
Time so we're coming back and what I wanted to ask you about is so it

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.080
sounds like you had a wild time in Nashville but I'm curious what was it

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.760
like dating during that time period when you're talking about from like

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:45.840
high school into your like late 20s? Well I only dated girls and I hated

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:49.820
dating the whole dating thing was so formalized that you know every

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:54.780
relationship I've ever been in just happened you know and I like it that

01:12:54.780 --> 01:13:03.380
way but I was a virgin until I was 23 I guess and I met a woman and we

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:08.700
married her father was Leonard Roberts who was a renowned American

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:13.380
folklorist and I considered going into folklore we were married for six

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:16.480
years we're still friends we still talk all the time her name is Lynn

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:24.660
Stansbury now we got married we we were married in 71 on Christmas Eve and

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:30.800
I guess our divorce came through in 76 or 77 we were both single we got

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:35.420
married we married one day apart in 2015

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:44.260
that's incredible what incredible timing it just it just happened we both

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:51.800
we both excuse me we both met somebody sorry um

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:59.780
so anyway so and then in the 80s I was I was really in love with with a

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:04.700
woman in east Tennessee and she could not stand me being trans and so that

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:10.900
just poisoned the well but it was a very passionate relationship and um I

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:16.320
wish it could have worked out but you know we were I had to be non-trans to

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.460
do it and I couldn't be non-trans I couldn't like I said I could decide

01:14:20.460 --> 01:14:25.040
what to do about being trans and curiously she liked me on hormones better

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:30.320
than when I tried to come off of hormones for her it was weird you know she

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:35.160
had it was she with the issue and not me unfortunately although I don't

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:41.360
think she would acknowledge that naturally right that's the joys of

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:48.880
relationships um so uh when we're the next question I have then is so being

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:53.060
primarily in relationships with women how has that been in terms of the

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:57.940
trans community particularly as you moved from Nashville to Atlanta before

01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:05.140
I answered that I want to I want to I want to say that um when it was out

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:10.820
as a woman people men would just follow over themselves you know I'm a

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:15.280
young girl and they would like holler at me as they drove by in cars and

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:21.180
try to get me in their cars with them and um one time I was sitting in the

01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:26.560
Greyhound station and a man I thought he was ancient he was probably 40 um

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:33.980
and I was probably 18 you know and I was I had rented a a motel room in the

01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:41.460
suburbs and I thought well I'll just ride the Greyhound bus back instead of

01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:44.520
the city bus but the Greyhound didn't leave for a while I'm okay and I

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:49.600
bought a magazine he was reading it and I get up to check the schedule and

01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:55.620
this this night time and this guy with two cups of soda comes over and I'll

01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:59.340
kind of run into him in the middle of the room and I said excuse me when I

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:02.200
looked at schedule sat down and he comes over to me and hands me a cup of

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:05.300
coffee said I've coke and said I bought this for you and I said well thank

01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:08.780
you and he's like he's trying to get me to come with him and buy me buy me

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:16.540
something to drink I had no experience with man um to give me something to

01:16:16.540 --> 01:16:21.800
eat rather he's a cab driver and I I don't know why but suddenly I find

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.860
myself going out and getting in his cab with him and he took us to a place

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:33.080
and we had dinner and he asked me to be his girlfriend and he took me to my

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:36.240
room and he was going to pick me up and take me to see his friends the next

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:40.420
day and of course I was not there the next day I changed and went back home

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:45.480
and I'm like well I mean I mean my whole experience the first time I ever

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:49.580
dressed was how much different my life would be had I been born a girl

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:57.140
instead of been born a boy and how much preferable that was for me you know

01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:06.560
so I had similar kind of encounters and it was it was mostly not that I

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:13.780
found men so attractive but that it was validating um so I was kind of too

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:20.480
busy in the 90s to be in a relationship I dated an FTM for a while um but I

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:26.800
was that relationship ended primarily because I was too busy to either take

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:34.080
care of himself or or me and and and then in 2006 friends told me about a

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:40.160
virtual world called Second Life where I still have two regions it's a

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.160
beautiful place called Wednesday and Second Life and I was not there a week

01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:50.340
before I met I met another avatar and I fell in love with the avatar first

01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:56.620
and she was buying she was building a house for me because I had bought

01:17:56.620 --> 01:18:00.720
some property and she was charging me 500 lindens which is about two

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:06.280
dollars us to uh because it's a virtual currency to to build a house and by

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:11.100
the time the house was built I was in love with her and she came to the IFG

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:20.020
conference in Philly in March and we met in person and it went from there

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:27.120
and and she came to Fantasia Fair with me that year um I was up and back

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:30.440
and forth visiting her for the next couple years as much as I could because

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:36.400
I had a lot of time off being a state employee and then I retired in 2009

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.420
and was there for four months and we would have been married at that point

01:18:39.420 --> 01:18:44.900
if we could have figured out how to afford a place to live and so

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:52.280
eventually she had lost her job and she her name is Heather she had lost

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.440
her job because they pretty much changed the corporate model and it wasn't

01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:02.800
a job for her um and she took a temporary position in an insurance agency

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:08.960
and is now vice president so she started making more money and with me

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:14.400
selling my house in Georgia we were able to to buy a nice house in an

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:19.640
expensive market because the taxes are really high here too and we've been

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.280
we've been doing really well we're going to Paris next month we've been

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.680
playing it very close to the desk since COVID started so this will be our

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:32.440
first vacation we haven't even been eating in restaurants so we're going to

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:36.060
Paris on the 10th I'm really excited I lived in France for four years

01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:42.820
growing up oh wow what uh that's all amazing if so many questions to follow

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:45.940
up on this one let's start with the Paris and then we'll work our way back

01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:49.260
so what were you doing in Paris growing up was it because your dad was in

01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:54.860
the military or yeah he was in the military and the the day school broke or

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:59.040
Christmas vacation we got on a plane and flew to New York and flew from

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:03.680
there to France my father picked us up in a jeep an open jeep in December

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:09.300
and at early airport I guess there must have been Charles de Gaulle airport

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:14.480
at the time anyway um and drives us to Orleans which is about 135

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:19.180
kilometers south and we lived in Orleans but we would go to France most at

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:23.840
least once a month to Paris about once a month you know so we you know got

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:28.340
to you know I got to see all the sites went to the Lou went to the Eiffel

01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:36.840
Tower went to the Arc de Triomphe went to the museums and we toured all the

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:42.640
dozens of castles in the Louis Valley in Paris regions and once a year we

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:47.620
went on vacation so I got to see Italy and Germany and Belgium and the

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:51.900
Netherlands then I don't think we ever made it to Switzerland and we didn't

01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:56.020
make it to Spain or Portugal or across the channel but you know I got to

01:20:56.020 --> 01:21:00.580
see a lot of western Europe and it just it felt like home I get home and

01:21:00.580 --> 01:21:06.880
that was 11 when we came back so and my my surgery was my genital surgery

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:12.500
was in Brussels so it felt really good to go to overseas I felt like I got

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:20.180
a vacation and in a major life uh alteration all in one trip no that's

01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:26.940
incredible well what was it like growing up in Europe and did you were you

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:31.600
playing with gender when in your youth when you were there or well I didn't

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:34.820
I don't think I really understood the difference I thought I guess I

01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:40.040
thought that the difference in boys and girls was in dresses versus pants

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:49.260
and hair length probably until I was eight or nine and I remember when I

01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:56.240
saw my first pubic hair I was I was actually in gym class and sitting I was

01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:00.960
we were playing baseball and I was in left field so I'm sitting there at a

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.100
picnic table and I look down and I see a pubic hair in my shorts and I'm

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:10.320
like oh my god I know what's coming and I don't want it so it was okay

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:15.940
being a boy but I did not want to be a man and yet it was that's felt like

01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:23.900
a feudal desire you know I'm gonna make that a reality so and and then you

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:33.980
know the first time I I put my face on which was probably age 14 um I

01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:37.700
absolutely looked in the mirror and saw a girl only and I couldn't see a

01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:41.360
boy anywhere and I never considered I looked androgynous but I must have

01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.760
because I can look at pictures now and I see how androgynous I was I had

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.820
kind of small facial features and

01:22:51.160 --> 01:22:54.920
just presenting as a female just always worked for me and my name was

01:22:54.920 --> 01:23:00.940
Dallas I didn't have to change it so um it was just like most of my life

01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:04.820
figuring out how to make this happen and I think what if I'd what if it had

01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:12.420
been 2020 you know and I'm and I'm 13 years old and I go to my parents and

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.680
the next thing I know I'm on puberty blockers what would my life have been

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:19.800
like I don't regret the way my life turned out but I do think what if

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:26.040
sometimes I think we all do absolutely I think that that's a really

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:30.680
interesting moment too in comparison and comparing over the course of your

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:36.120
life when you're talking about your transition what was the process for you

01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:41.600
like how did that kind of manifest itself in terms of choices you made step

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:45.480
by step well I've been in hormones for 10 years I'd had electrolysis and I

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:48.820
went right I was kissing my girlfriend one time and these guys were

01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:53.120
laughing and I said why are they laughing I said because she said because

01:23:53.120 --> 01:24:00.240
they think we're two girls and I looked and I'm like oh my god yes you know

01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:11.440
that's exactly what they're laughing um but I uh so I had no facial hair I

01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:16.420
had my own hair on my head you know I my name is already Dallas I had a

01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:21.820
very androgynous appearance in my driver's license um and I have a

01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:27.300
situation a place to live and then a way to make some money in in Georgia

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:34.560
and I've broken up with my girlfriend so um I just rented a van and moved

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.700
to Atlanta and that was the last time I presented his mail was before I

01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:42.800
left the place and I considered just stepping out of my jeans and shirt and

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.920
leaving them in the floor because but it was cheap symbolism so I I put

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.960
them in the trash but I've not presented his mail since the day I left

01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:57.740
Tennessee and then once you uh got to Atlanta you started taking more

01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:02.140
active steps because it sounds like you went to Brussels at one point did

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:08.280
you have yeah I so I was drafted to run the the the Montgomery group I've

01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.940
been doing that for a few months so it threw me right in the middle of

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:15.940
things and of all things trans in Atlanta you know some writing articles to

01:25:15.940 --> 01:25:21.340
educate the gay community and again lesbian community and I'm going to

01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:24.620
support group meetings and people are coming to me for assistance and

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:30.960
support um you know and and I launched Aegis and it was like having a tiger

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:36.560
by the tail you know so meanwhile I'm looking after my own issues and I'm

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:40.600
like well it's never been all about surgery for me but what is a girl doing

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:47.140
with this thing on her body you know and so there was a doctor I just wrote

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:51.180
I'm talking to someone about is doing research on him his name was Michael

01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:56.660
Seegers and he was a surgeon of the hand was especially he'd been doing

01:25:56.660 --> 01:26:02.020
surgery on trans women for a while um he had quite a few operations under

01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:10.060
his belt he it cost four thousand dollars to was he in Denver or was no

01:26:10.060 --> 01:26:15.180
that's that's um fiber you think about fiber was 12 or 14 I think at the

01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:22.320
time but because the German the Belgian government would pick up the cost

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.300
of the hospitalization the entire fee for surgery in Brussels was four

01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:31.080
thousand dollars and I was really impressed with him because one he was a

01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.420
surgeon of the hand so he understood small nerves and I was interested in

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:41.240
having nerve connections down there second because during horrible 1960 war

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.060
in what was then the Belgian Congo he was doing heroic facial

01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:50.680
reconstructions of people who'd had large parts of their head shot off

01:26:50.680 --> 01:27:00.500
under primitive conditions and third because when his daughter had had was

01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:04.860
in a horrible car wreck he rebuilt her you know like the six million dollar

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:11.240
man he says we can rebuild her you know and salvaged what was a ravaged

01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:17.280
face and his price was right and you know his people seemed to heal really

01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:21.480
fast they're talking about going around Brussels shopping three days after

01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:27.520
surgery and I'm like that seems amazing so so that's where I went to go and

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:33.360
I happened to have four thousand I don't think I had 12,000 you know um so

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:37.240
I so I went over to Brussels and had my surgery and it was a vacation and a

01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:42.540
life change at the same time and that's incredible did he go with somebody

01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:47.780
or did he go I did I went I did went with a woman who uh another trans

01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:52.300
woman and we had surgery on the same day she and then me and she totally

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:58.680
decompensated after surgery she just became a whiny little thing and needy

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:02.980
and she grew her facial hair out and so she she hadn't had no electrolysis

01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:08.620
so she looked like a lumberjack after day three pretty much and was not

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:13.980
kind to the staff and um and I'm like I woke up from surgery and I had

01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:18.080
brought a copy of Stephen King's The Stand which was new at the time

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.720
because it was such a new book I mean he was going to be down on so so I

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:27.340
just woke up from an operation and opened the book and started reading I

01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:31.980
was like totally I'm kind of an imperturbable person anyway I don't get

01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:37.960
highly emotional about much it takes a lot to get me upset even when I'm

01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:43.500
upset I might not show it but um yeah so I was like I was perfectly fine it

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:48.500
felt like a small pony was standing on my groin but there was no pain just

01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:53.460
pressure so it didn't bother me at all she was crying about pain and

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:57.480
getting pain medicine and she was still a mess by the time I got back to

01:28:57.480 --> 01:29:03.340
the States did you see connected with her after her I saw her once after

01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:09.280
that um she worked in a bank where no one knew in another city in Georgia

01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:13.580
and I was out with a friend who's trans and we were going into an antique

01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:17.700
mall and she was coming out on the arms of an older gentleman and you could

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:21.440
see the panic on her face like oh my god are they going to say anything of

01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:26.620
course we didn't we recognized her but we didn't say anything um and I and

01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:32.460
I mean stealth is a prison and you know and I thought I was going to have

01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:37.260
ghost elf because that was what we were told to do by the gender clinics um

01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:43.760
and I passed and I had a job and you know and I I thought thought that was

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:47.560
the thing to do but I you know I still thought it was important that

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:55.060
everything I'd ever been or learned made me perfect for doing the work I

01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:59.760
was doing and helping people and I that that took priority and before I

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:02.800
knew it stuff was an option because the internet came out and my name's all

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:07.360
over the place and I like it that way I don't want to have to do gender 101

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:14.200
if I go to buy milk at the convenience store but I don't care who knows I

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:17.860
mean I don't want to be in a position of danger because someone reads me

01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:23.360
that's scary and I feel for my brothers and sisters who don't have that

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:32.820
sort of lack of need to fear um and I feel guilty about it sometimes yeah

01:30:32.820 --> 01:30:37.060
that's a hard one I was going to ask you what your relationship with um

01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:41.460
either passing or being stealth has been because you said it's been uh at

01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:47.540
times was fairly easy yeah well when I got in my late 20s suddenly it

01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:52.360
suddenly wasn't easy I had to wear a wig and you know my and I had to wear

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:57.020
heavy makeup on my face and before it was just you know makeup was this

01:30:57.020 --> 01:31:01.780
look like any young woman's you know it just made me look better I didn't

01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:07.020
cover anything up and um within a year being on hormones all that was in

01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:11.220
the past but actually worked for a while as a Kelly I think it was still

01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:16.440
Kelly girl instead of Kelly services and I took a job at Fisk University in

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:22.180
Nashville and and and I kind of got adopted by one of the secretaries and

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:25.120
she taught me how to do the she told me about the numbers you know like

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:29.220
where they have a number and you bet on it every day and she told me how to

01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:33.060
apply because she knew I would get the job if I did and but I was fighting

01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:36.980
my body I wrote this article for chrysalis called my three transitions

01:31:36.980 --> 01:31:42.480
which was about being at the Ross high proof high proof hotel at age 18 so

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:49.640
having no obligations or ties and being one eight dollar a week hotel room

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:53.940
away from being able to live full time and I couldn't because I didn't have

01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:59.380
any mechanism to support myself the second time was when I was in my late

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:05.240
20s I'm again I'm divorced I have a possibility of a job but my body's an

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:12.760
obstacle in the third time I had I had I knew people I had some support and

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:16.640
my body was again compliant and so that's when I finally transitioned that

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:22.060
I would have happily transitioned at age 18 and like I said I don't regret

01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:28.120
not doing it but I do think about what if sometimes absolutely but you

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:33.120
managed to do all this and still go to high school I mean go to college and

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:37.300
graduate school did you what was that like how did you get through that

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:46.020
well in well when I got married I grew a beard which and my and my wife was

01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:52.020
understanding and whatever it was a really issue in our marriage um never

01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:55.880
had been and as I said we were main friends but the only thing that

01:32:55.880 --> 01:33:00.460
happened in college and I I got I did four years and two and a half years I

01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:05.480
was really at a fast club middle Tennessee State University and Murphy's

01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:12.480
were outside of national 36 miles um the only thing that happened was I

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:17.980
found a compendium of underground comics and I just discovered those

01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:22.040
because a friend of mine had a copy of zap number four underground comic by

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:24.080
mostly Robert from

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:30.080
and there were all these stories in there and I'm just thumbing through it

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:34.840
in the bookstore and I'm poor as a church mouse you know and here's this

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:41.240
trans positive article there's this girl in San Francisco young trans woman

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:45.320
and she's like oh I'm out of hormones I guess I better go get some hormones

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:49.740
and she's jumping on the trolley car and that was so exciting that I never

01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:52.820
finished the story I would read one panel every time I went to the

01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:56.520
bookstore and then the semester was over the book was gone and I've been

01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.120
trying to find it ever since I never got the outcome but it was so

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:07.140
liberating see her jump on that trolley car and that was the next thing

01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:13.260
that happened was more than 10 years later and I was at a meeting of the

01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:18.220
animal behavior society at Duke University and they had University of

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:22.900
Chicago had a stand of books there and there was Kessler and McKendors

01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:28.460
McKendors gender and ethno methodological approach and that made a lot of

01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:32.880
sense and it's about how mostly how if you have one or two male attributes

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:36.300
it throws over any feminine attribute that you have so if you're a very

01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:41.120
feminine woman with a beard you're almost going to be heed you know but

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:45.200
there's an appendix where they're talking about a trans woman and I'm like

01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:49.660
oh my god I know that woman I had never met a trans woman I go to the

01:34:49.660 --> 01:34:57.140
University of Tennessee in 1974 I'm working in the lab of Joel Lubar it is

01:34:57.140 --> 01:35:00.680
a biofeedback lab he has a big government grant so it's like a quarter of a

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:07.460
million dollars and you know a year involved and three three walls of the

01:35:07.460 --> 01:35:13.920
room are covered with transistor panels now the eight-bit chip which which

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:19.160
enable like Apple computers and stuff was not yet released there were only

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.380
four-bit chips which is about enough to do like a little hand calculator so

01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:31.040
it was all built on four-chip four-bit chip logic and so there's probably

01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:36.860
150 panels with lights and dials and switches running this biofeedback lab

01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:42.600
so they can record brain waves of people with epilepsy and do biofeedback

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:50.480
and a graduate student called Chad had designed it all and everyone is like

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:53.300
something's going on with Chad we don't know what's going on with Chad and

01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:58.260
I got one to meet Chad because he sounded interesting and one day Chad one

01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:01.980
night I'm sitting there you know doing my chore in the lab and Chad shows

01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:06.000
up with three of his friends he's barefoot he has long hair and he has what

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.560
I now recognize was electrolysis burns on his face and he's showing his

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:16.280
friends the lab he designed and then about a week later all the other grad

01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:21.180
students are complaining because Chad has shown up and demanded that he be

01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:26.700
called Renee from now on well and I'm like this is interesting I finally

01:36:26.700 --> 01:36:31.980
meet Renee and she proceeded in the course of about an hour and a half to

01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:36.320
teach me about transistor transistor logic which is like ins and ores and

01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:40.400
nor gates which was entirely different from anything I'd ever experienced

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:48.520
before it was fascinating and she was a good teacher and that was her only

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:53.380
interaction until the second time I saw her and she explained that she

01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:58.260
never demanded she be called Renee she simply requested that they call her

01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:03.400
Renee and so I suggest thinking in my crude way I'm going to come out to

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:08.360
her I said we go to a drag show and she proceeds to tell me that drag is an

01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:15.920
insult to feminism you know I also read an article in a Ms magazine she had

01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:21.380
left in the lab which was Alan Alda's article about testosterone poisoning

01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:30.420
which is fairly famous now so the and the third time I saw her so she would

01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:36.460
not have graduated had she not been the only one who could keep that lab

01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:39.600
running she built it and she kept it running and there was a lot of money

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:45.140
involved so she let her graduate and she took a job in Texas and she and

01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:53.090
she did very well but the last time I saw her this is the only transsexual

01:37:53.090 --> 01:38:02.170
woman I ever met before age 4 39 she's sold her car her belongings were all

01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:05.710
packed up she's going home to close her apartment out for the last time and

01:38:05.710 --> 01:38:13.110
I gave her a ride and that is she's very sweet I almost reveal myself my

01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:17.530
marriage was breaking up at the time and I almost came out to her and I did

01:38:17.530 --> 01:38:21.450
it because I'm like well she's gone you know like I don't want to lay this

01:38:21.450 --> 01:38:28.610
on her at this late date but 10 years later at the animal behavior society

01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:33.030
I pick up this book by Kessler and McKenna and I look in the back of the

01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:37.330
book at the appendix and it's it's their correspondence with a transsexual

01:38:37.330 --> 01:38:41.610
woman and even though they had been very professional and covered up almost

01:38:41.610 --> 01:38:45.310
every aspect of her identity it was just enough for me to know it was her

01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:51.790
they moved her to Texas you know and changed other incidentals but I knew

01:38:51.790 --> 01:38:58.670
it was her and so in the 90s I guess it was there was late 90s maybe early

01:38:58.670 --> 01:39:04.570
part of the century there was a feminist journal um there was doing a

01:39:04.570 --> 01:39:09.330
special issue about that book of Kessler and McKenna's and I wrote a

01:39:09.330 --> 01:39:15.310
chapter called Rachel and me they called her Rachel in the uh and I I

01:39:15.310 --> 01:39:20.210
should probably not have said her name on this on this her first name on

01:39:20.210 --> 01:39:24.290
this on this take I wasn't thinking not a problem we can edit that out

01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:31.910
later okay yeah um but I wrote an article and I contacted Suzanne Kessler

01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:35.490
and I said I don't want to know any particular the bad but I'd just like to

01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:38.670
know if she's doing well and they said yes she is and I'm saying so good

01:39:38.670 --> 01:39:45.550
but what a coincidence that was you know that that that I happened to pick

01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:50.630
that book up and happened to recognize she was there and it's another what

01:39:50.630 --> 01:39:54.690
if what if I had been able to I'd been there a year earlier and I'd had a

01:39:54.690 --> 01:39:59.830
chance to become a friend and and disclose to her and and through her meet

01:39:59.830 --> 01:40:06.110
the resources I've been looking for my whole life absolutely

01:40:06.110 --> 01:40:10.050
it's a lot of connections that you have to right like these turning point

01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:13.990
moments yeah which when they're happening you don't think about them that

01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:18.210
way but later on you're like oh my god yeah absolutely well I was going to

01:40:18.210 --> 01:40:22.270
say you're you've been involved with two projects so I think uh also fall

01:40:22.270 --> 01:40:26.650
into that one is southern comfort and then of course fantasia fair yeah

01:40:26.650 --> 01:40:29.530
talking about these moments I was wondering if we could talk about southern

01:40:29.530 --> 01:40:33.710
comfort for a little bit how you got involved what your experience was like

01:40:33.710 --> 01:40:40.030
high moments low moments early very early nineties pre-internet I mean it

01:40:40.030 --> 01:40:44.330
was DARPA net which was just government agencies talking but there was no

01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:51.550
public internet but we're communicating as a as a forming community through

01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:57.750
newsletters and magazines and IFG is kind of like the umbrella and you know

01:40:57.750 --> 01:41:02.850
they have a conference we can all go to and a woman called Sabrina Marcus

01:41:02.850 --> 01:41:08.310
goes to the IAFGE she lived in Florida she goes to the IAFGE office and

01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:12.870
says you know you got like all these conferences and other parts of the

01:41:12.870 --> 01:41:16.950
country like the Beall in Chicago and we need a conference in the south

01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:19.870
when you put a conference on in the south and they said no but we'll teach

01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:25.250
you how to put on a conference so she got in touch with everybody in the

01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:29.430
south about 20 organizations as far away as Arkansas and Virginia and

01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:34.070
Florida and we all met up at the Lecinta Inn on Piedmont it was a Lecinta

01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:38.410
Inn I don't know what it is now and we had a planning meeting and IFGE sent

01:41:38.410 --> 01:41:44.850
two people down the director and the office manager and um what time is it

01:41:44.850 --> 01:41:51.270
three okay I've got a yard man coming at four and I have to take a quick

01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:56.950
break when he comes um this one let me check my make sure this is not him

01:41:57.910 --> 01:42:03.430
sorry no not a problem at all yeah he wanted to uh

01:42:13.290 --> 01:42:19.470
he wouldn't wanted to confirm my address yeah absolutely about that I don't

01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:25.650
know so by the time the weekend the the meeting is over I guess we did it

01:42:25.650 --> 01:42:29.910
on one or two days we have a name we have an idea we have a concept and we

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:34.950
launched Southern Comfort and I I paid $75 out of my own pocket is startup

01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:39.110
money for it and a bunch of other people did too so there were a lot of you

01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:44.730
know groups that were responsible for running the Southern Comfort and then

01:42:44.730 --> 01:42:49.290
at the end of the first conference I'm interviewing Michael Seegers who had

01:42:49.290 --> 01:42:54.570
done my surgery this was 91 and the Montgomery's were like raising hell

01:42:54.570 --> 01:42:59.390
about me you know because um I had to cut my interview with Michael Seegers

01:42:59.390 --> 01:43:04.370
short because Lynn was saying some pretty outrageous things about me and

01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:11.150
she says we have a file here on Dallas Denny does anyone want to see it and

01:43:11.150 --> 01:43:16.250
no one wanted to see it and that's kind of the end of it for the

01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:18.630
Montgomery's I'm sorry reading me again

01:43:21.850 --> 01:43:28.330
this is 345 so if maybe take a 15 minute break if we're not done well yeah

01:43:28.330 --> 01:43:31.070
we I was gonna say we can also finish at that time and if there's more we

01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:36.270
can always schedule another session you've got sorry so anyway so Southern

01:43:36.270 --> 01:43:39.470
Comfort comes and it's a big success and Linda Peacock who I mentioned

01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:44.690
earlier was was in charge and it were about 150 people it was wonderful

01:43:44.690 --> 01:43:49.830
wonderful energy um and out of that grew you know what was the largest

01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:55.810
trans conference for many years and I was you know I was one of many

01:43:55.810 --> 01:44:01.230
founders I consider myself and I was really sad when Southern Comfort moved

01:44:01.230 --> 01:44:06.650
to Fort Lauderdale because the circumstances there were um two surgeons who

01:44:06.650 --> 01:44:09.690
presented at the conference were suing one another and one of them included

01:44:09.690 --> 01:44:15.290
the Southern Comfort board in this lawsuit meanwhile in Fort Lauderdale

01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:22.190
they had hired someone 10 years earlier to bring gay and lesbian tourism to

01:44:22.190 --> 01:44:25.570
Fort Lauderdale and had been so successful they read about Southern Comfort

01:44:25.570 --> 01:44:29.390
and said okay we're going to hire someone to bring trans business to Fort

01:44:29.390 --> 01:44:32.830
Lauderdale so they get approached with a sweetheart deal by Fort Lauderdale

01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:38.350
they they make a QR code to go in the back of the ticket the conference

01:44:38.350 --> 01:44:45.490
that must have been 2013 or 2014 2012 maybe and it says that the they were

01:44:45.490 --> 01:44:50.930
going to tell everybody to scan their their badges at the final banquet

01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:54.470
which is a surprise for the next three years Southern Comfort will be in

01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:59.370
Fort Lauderdale Florida well it was scanned before it even got when it was

01:44:59.370 --> 01:45:06.590
stuffing on the lobes and so a lot of people were were um aghast one one

01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:10.810
has been no discussion about this there's been no polling of the members

01:45:10.810 --> 01:45:14.850
and second I'm already driving all day to get to Atlanta I can't do another

01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:20.510
day to get to Fort Lauderdale and so a bunch of this met in Blake Alford's

01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:25.510
hotel room on Sunday and we formed Thea Transgender Health and Education

01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:33.410
Alliance and had two conferences before it kind of petered out so but

01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:40.030
Fantasia Fair I got invited to Allison Lang late Allison Lang gave me a

01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:44.150
call invited me to be on the board at Fantasia Fair now I knew about

01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:53.550
Fantasia Fair because in 1980 it was an article by writer D. Keith Mano in

01:45:53.550 --> 01:46:00.010
the November 80 issue of Playboy Magazine and he was kind of there like he

01:46:00.010 --> 01:46:05.630
was what do they call it when when they implant a reporter in a military

01:46:05.630 --> 01:46:10.650
unit he was kind of like a participant observer so he actually crossed us

01:46:10.650 --> 01:46:14.550
you know oh so he was embedded right embedded that's the word I was looking

01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:21.950
for so so you know yeah he he is embedded in and I'm like oh my god you

01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:25.250
know because I was looking for community then 1980s right after the whole

01:46:25.250 --> 01:46:29.090
Virginia Prince thing and right after the whole Vanderbilt University thing

01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:35.090
and but he is really on about how expensive and exclusive it is and I look

01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:39.470
at my finances I was actually off for those two weeks I had a two week on

01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:44.510
two week off schedule my job but I had just about enough money to buy

01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:49.870
gasoline to get to Cape Cod and back and none for rooms and none for food

01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:55.590
and none for registration so I didn't go but so I knew about Fantasia Fair

01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:59.430
and I and I'd been hearing rumors about the fair and I got invited and I

01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:05.370
knew that the person running the fair was the fair was having some problems

01:47:05.370 --> 01:47:08.030
it's all I'm going to say about it at this point because that person is

01:47:08.030 --> 01:47:13.230
still around but I you know I felt like it needed some assistance and I'm

01:47:13.230 --> 01:47:16.830
sure I'm happy to be on another board and I went and fell in love with the

01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:20.770
town and fell in love with the town's people and fell in love with the

01:47:20.770 --> 01:47:26.230
attendees and so I've been going every year since 2000 and I guess two and

01:47:26.230 --> 01:47:30.830
I've been in a leadership position all that time as director for many years

01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:35.550
and board chair I'm board chair now the organization that runs it what

01:47:35.550 --> 01:47:40.790
makes Fantasia Fair particularly special and what are like thinking about

01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:45.250
what are some of the big highlights maybe historically of it like some of

01:47:45.250 --> 01:47:50.810
the better events speakers etc what do you see as being those things well

01:47:50.810 --> 01:47:55.290
well first there's the town it was chosen because even in 1975 when the

01:47:55.290 --> 01:48:00.530
first fair was held Problems Town was a was a affirming and welcoming

01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:05.650
community for all kinds of queer people and and trans people were going up

01:48:05.650 --> 01:48:11.510
there and not having a big problem so they had a they had a I have another

01:48:11.510 --> 01:48:15.930
little story I can tell you here but based on my interviews with Ari Kaine

01:48:15.930 --> 01:48:22.410
they Ari was elected to run the first one it was the head the point person

01:48:22.410 --> 01:48:27.030
he sets everything up at a hotel called Gifford house he has all these

01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:30.550
people lined up coming from all over the United States and some from out of

01:48:30.550 --> 01:48:34.370
the United States and he gets a call from a friend two weeks before the

01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:37.910
conference and the Gifford house has been padlocked because it's been

01:48:38.530 --> 01:48:44.330
foreclosed upon by the bank he's like oh crap these and he's like at that

01:48:44.330 --> 01:48:48.590
point everybody's corresponding through mailboxes with secret codes you

01:48:48.590 --> 01:48:52.930
have to send off to a central place with the code to contact somebody and

01:48:52.930 --> 01:48:57.330
he's like how much there's no way you know but fortunately Stan Sorrentino

01:48:57.330 --> 01:49:01.850
who was the co-owner of the crown and anchor and a mobster he got went to

01:49:01.850 --> 01:49:12.490
prison or or tax evasion stepped in and and Ari speaks very kindly of Stan

01:49:12.490 --> 01:49:16.470
offered to to host everything and then we're going to have everything was

01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:20.490
going to be in the event all the rooms all the events and by the end of the

01:49:20.490 --> 01:49:24.130
week everyone realized you can go anywhere in town in Provincetown and no

01:49:24.130 --> 01:49:29.750
one will blink at you now so the fair was 10 days long it's now seven so

01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:34.810
here's a chance to be your authentic self for a week or 10 days in a

01:49:34.810 --> 01:49:38.210
situation where you can go and do anything you want and no one takes a

01:49:38.210 --> 01:49:43.330
second look at you and you have you have total acceptance it's life

01:49:43.330 --> 01:49:48.650
transforming for many people we actually have a session we do to talk

01:49:48.650 --> 01:49:52.130
people out of the Provincetown fog you know don't go home and make any snap

01:49:52.130 --> 01:49:56.570
decisions about your life till you have a chance to digest this for a month

01:49:56.570 --> 01:50:03.030
or two and sometimes people still do but you know it has a really there's a

01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:10.710
really strong program for partners it was all like all like makeup and hair

01:50:10.710 --> 01:50:13.730
for the first few years but when I went I made sure we started doing

01:50:13.730 --> 01:50:22.250
politics and history and all that stuff and so we have a really strong

01:50:22.250 --> 01:50:28.710
educational program it's a it's it's just and it's small it's intimate

01:50:28.710 --> 01:50:33.910
there's only maybe usually a hundred people there so you have you have time

01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:39.410
to really get to know people like like the whole like I spent a whole week

01:50:39.410 --> 01:50:46.670
with Virginia Prince there that's what I made that's fantastic um and it's

01:50:46.670 --> 01:50:49.670
changed over the years right it started as tradition it started

01:50:49.670 --> 01:50:55.570
traditionally as uh empty out and yes yes and you know I made everybody

01:50:55.570 --> 01:51:02.310
quit saying ladies and gentlemen at all the dinners I mean ladies they was

01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:05.550
like welcome ladies because they were gentlemen in the office in the

01:51:05.550 --> 01:51:11.090
audience and I made them stop saying okay now they say ladies and gentlemen

01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:14.910
but then I said no that's not good enough anymore we have to say welcome

01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:19.450
everybody because they're an unbinary people and some of the older

01:51:19.450 --> 01:51:26.810
attendees now identify as non-binary it's still an older demographic and

01:51:26.810 --> 01:51:32.130
largely a white demographic and we recently transitioned the name to

01:51:32.130 --> 01:51:35.390
transgender week with the idea that anyone who wants to come to

01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:40.450
Provincetown that week can come and many of our activities are free you can

01:51:40.450 --> 01:51:46.950
go and everybody's welcome and maybe we can whack that older demographic

01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:51.930
and and yet maintain enough of a structure for those people to have the

01:51:51.930 --> 01:51:55.910
security and support they need to discover themselves so that's my hope

01:51:56.790 --> 01:52:00.790
that's fantastic and what's been um I really appreciate you acknowledging

01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:06.390
like the age demographics too how has that like how have the

01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:11.470
intergenerational conversations been going at you know what we'll call

01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:16.030
trans week now right a lot of the a lot of the younger people have been

01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:21.750
very uncomfortable I think that's to some extent because of insensitivity

01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:26.010
of the older people and to some extent because so many young people are

01:52:26.010 --> 01:52:30.710
just prickly you know and they take offense at the slightest if they get

01:52:30.710 --> 01:52:35.270
misgendered by accident that's as bad as if they were purposefully hayfully

01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:40.130
misgendered which I make a big distinction between or someone will ask them

01:52:40.130 --> 01:52:44.290
because they're curious because they're looking at exploring that option

01:52:44.290 --> 01:52:48.710
for themselves about what they're about and they take offense at that so

01:52:48.710 --> 01:52:54.130
I'm not yet figured out how we avoid that but I think just getting lots and

01:52:54.130 --> 01:52:59.250
lots of young people to talent to just have a good time might might solve

01:52:59.250 --> 01:53:05.990
that problem absolutely I think it's interesting too that that what you

01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:09.410
just said is like people asking questions because they're trying to reflect

01:53:09.410 --> 01:53:13.070
on themselves has that been your experience while you're there particularly

01:53:13.070 --> 01:53:16.990
yeah three or four people that I know of out of the hundred or now

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:22.130
identifying as non-binary you know and when I when I came I realized a lot

01:53:22.130 --> 01:53:24.530
of the people there probably a third of the people there were not cross

01:53:24.530 --> 01:53:29.110
-dresses but were transsexual like me you know and they were trans men and

01:53:29.110 --> 01:53:39.290
we've been you know we've been giving the the pioneer awards are are it

01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:43.410
kind of excludes young people because it's a lifetime achievement award but

01:53:43.410 --> 01:53:47.190
that's the only reason so we've been giving a lot of awards to trans men

01:53:47.190 --> 01:53:53.110
people of color and trans women too you know because it's we're trying to

01:53:53.110 --> 01:53:58.290
recognize the achievement of people by Jude Patton who got the award last

01:53:58.290 --> 01:54:03.490
year and Rupert Raj you know Jenny Boylan who got it a few years ago

01:54:03.490 --> 01:54:09.310
Jameson Green and I got it one year I took a year off and I came back and

01:54:09.310 --> 01:54:13.970
gave them me the award but I'm very proud of the award because so many of

01:54:13.970 --> 01:54:19.670
those people including Virginia you know I told you before I considered

01:54:19.670 --> 01:54:23.230
Virginia kind of a closet transsexual because she was dating the edge you

01:54:23.230 --> 01:54:31.910
wrote about that it's on tape with Robert Stolar interviewing her um but in

01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:36.710
any situation where you can identify with a cross dresser or a cisgender

01:54:36.710 --> 01:54:40.650
woman she identifies with the cross dresser I identify with the cisgender

01:54:40.650 --> 01:54:45.810
woman and that's when I realized she was really different from me but she

01:54:45.810 --> 01:54:51.350
gave quite a bit of her money away to other trans people

01:54:54.570 --> 01:54:59.490
yeah clearly there's a complicated history with Virginia did you have other

01:54:59.490 --> 01:55:03.610
do you consider her like in trans role model or did you have other folks

01:55:03.610 --> 01:55:07.350
who kind of mentored your you more I know you've talked about support

01:55:07.350 --> 01:55:12.070
groups and things but more particular folks I never considered her a role

01:55:12.070 --> 01:55:17.090
model she was almost like an anti role model I mean yeah she lived full

01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:22.310
time and yeah that was my goal but you know how she enforced the gender

01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:26.870
boundaries was so distasteful to me it overwrote almost everything else she

01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:35.430
did um Ari who continued to be active in Fantasia Fair was called himself

01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:39.930
an androgyne he was really an early non-binary person when there was not

01:55:39.930 --> 01:55:44.590
that term to identify with and still does identify as non-binary and

01:55:44.590 --> 01:55:46.530
ambisexual um

01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:54.270
role models I remember seeing canary con on the tv program and thinking oh

01:55:54.270 --> 01:55:58.030
you know she just looks like any cisgender young woman and maybe it's

01:55:58.030 --> 01:56:02.310
possible for me to do that because I did not want to I did not want a life

01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:08.170
that I would be not able to have an income be forced to do things I didn't

01:56:08.170 --> 01:56:14.410
want to do to survive or to be harassed and on the streets and so I

01:56:14.410 --> 01:56:21.230
certainly realized you know and then um I loved Holly Boswell's take on

01:56:21.230 --> 01:56:28.930
things she was non-binary and I was trans but um I loved I loved her views

01:56:28.930 --> 01:56:37.550
and and beliefs and her open groups and emulated us as much as possible um

01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:41.730
but now I don't think I ever had like a role model or people I admire and

01:56:41.730 --> 01:56:50.110
respect like Jameson Green um tremendously um and now there's um I was a

01:56:50.110 --> 01:56:54.710
bit taken with news about Christine Jorgensen and what courage she must

01:56:54.710 --> 01:57:02.570
have had to transition in 1952 um and at age when I think I wrote a chapter

01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:10.150
about her um in a cold quite black, telethon, white refrigerators when you

01:57:10.150 --> 01:57:14.190
know science could do anything and by gosh now those men scientists can

01:57:14.190 --> 01:57:19.630
turn men into women what will they think of next so that a little bit um

01:57:19.630 --> 01:57:27.110
but no I never really had a role model I don't believe in role models fair

01:57:27.110 --> 01:57:30.170
enough I appreciate that well and especially since you've been kind of

01:57:30.170 --> 01:57:35.810
trailblazing through so much of it um which leads me to uh kind of I know

01:57:35.810 --> 01:57:40.370
we're getting close on time so we'll go towards uh one or two last

01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:43.490
questions but one of the ones that I was thinking about is this whole time

01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:48.390
you've done most of this work primarily in the south in Georgia and Atlanta

01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:54.390
particularly what kept you there for so long what was like what was the

01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:58.930
draw there what were the highs and lows of that well well my job did I was

01:57:58.930 --> 01:58:03.630
I was working on a national basis except for the support group after the

01:58:03.630 --> 01:58:08.530
first little while um and as I said I really felt I had the tiger by the

01:58:08.530 --> 01:58:17.810
tail you know because I was having great influence upon um Habigda um and I

01:58:17.810 --> 01:58:22.590
could do that anywhere my job was in Atlanta eventually in 98 I bought a

01:58:22.590 --> 01:58:27.710
home in Pine Lake which I really loved I'm a beautiful little community um

01:58:27.710 --> 01:58:31.250
so and I always thought I would retire to Asheville where I was born in

01:58:31.250 --> 01:58:36.650
North Carolina but I never did and and you know love brought me to New

01:58:36.650 --> 01:58:41.930
Jersey we live in the mountains it's very nice it's very rural and not

01:58:41.930 --> 01:58:47.250
unlike the North Georgia mountains in many ways we have bears they get in

01:58:47.250 --> 01:58:53.770
our trash can we have to have a bear proof trash can the bears can still

01:58:53.770 --> 01:59:02.870
unscrew the top amazing um I like that uh I appreciate that imagery too uh

01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:09.190
so I love it you do it land on their back with their hands I think but um

01:59:09.790 --> 01:59:15.850
they're pretty clever yeah absolutely well um one of the things that I was

01:59:15.850 --> 01:59:21.290
also wondering is when you're thinking about like being trans in the south

01:59:21.290 --> 01:59:27.250
or in Georgia particularly how does it differ from being trans other places

01:59:27.250 --> 01:59:33.970
or does it well you know I excuse me the south was the scary place to be

01:59:33.970 --> 01:59:40.870
gay was a scary place to be trans um when I was young not so much anymore

01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:44.550
it's just scary now to be trans anywhere especially with all this hate

01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:50.550
legislation that's being um proposed and often passed it's it's as a that's

01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:57.510
what I was talking with Chelsea about this morning um but it was my culture

01:59:57.510 --> 02:00:01.350
you know I lived except for the four years in France I in the couple years

02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:05.790
in Arizona I lived I was growing up in the south and lived in the south and

02:00:05.790 --> 02:00:10.130
it was just home and I never lived in the north I never lived in the

02:00:10.130 --> 02:00:16.670
midwest and um there was no real reason to live I had finally found

02:00:16.670 --> 02:00:25.190
community and it was in Atlanta and there was no real reason to leave yeah

02:00:25.190 --> 02:00:28.550
absolutely that once you get that sense of connection it's hard to want to

02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:33.870
move away from that um so I want to check in about time right now because I

02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:38.970
know it's getting close do you want to just do one more question and then

02:00:38.970 --> 02:00:44.750
one more question he said 345 he would be here okay um so why don't we do

02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:48.110
one of the kind of standard ending questions and then we'll set up a time

02:00:48.110 --> 02:00:54.890
to follow up which is as you're thinking about things right now what or who

02:00:54.890 --> 02:00:59.190
is inspiring you right now clearly you've done a lot to inspire others uh

02:00:59.190 --> 02:01:04.590
what's uh keeping you going right now well I mean I look at all the people

02:01:04.590 --> 02:01:11.870
that are out there on the forefront providing trans positive care affirming

02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:18.210
gender care um and taking a lot of heat for it and admire them for that I

02:01:18.210 --> 02:01:23.010
admire the corporations that stand up for us and don't cave like a house of

02:01:23.010 --> 02:01:28.550
cards the minute they get a little bit of pressure um the the people that

02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:31.770
are producing all this positive media because you know if there was a

02:01:31.770 --> 02:01:36.530
period in 20 years or more if you saw a trans person on tv they were serial

02:01:36.530 --> 02:01:46.230
filler I can talk chapter and book about that but um young people knowing

02:01:46.230 --> 02:01:50.310
who they are and being able to do something about it it's all very

02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:58.390
inspiring to me and yet overall I'm really concerned right now because what

02:01:58.390 --> 02:02:02.310
happened to the v mar republic looks like it's starting to happen here and

02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:07.830
I'm very concerned about the future of the united states and hoping that we

02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:13.830
prevail and are american and and don't go far down the road into nazism

02:02:13.830 --> 02:02:21.930
which seems to be happening and what's really scares me about it is is how

02:02:21.930 --> 02:02:27.930
easy and widespread the misinformation is and disinformation and now it'll

02:02:27.930 --> 02:02:31.730
be automatically generated by AI and they won't even have to write it

02:02:31.730 --> 02:02:35.910
anymore so

02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:40.470
it was scary yeah absolutely I think it's an interesting time again

02:02:40.470 --> 02:02:44.750
especially as we're looking at some of the uh trans medicalization bills

02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:50.310
that have been coming through let alone book bans etc so that's then you

02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:58.110
know um and I'm convinced it's going to be there's going to be an increase

02:02:58.110 --> 02:03:03.190
in violence against us and you know and I mean I'm not worried if I'm out

02:03:03.190 --> 02:03:06.430
on the street about being attacked because no one knows but I'm all over

02:03:06.430 --> 02:03:11.270
the internet if anyone ever wanted to come take me out they would only have

02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:16.850
a hard time figuring out where I was and where to find me and uh so at the

02:03:16.850 --> 02:03:21.510
back of my mind is you know when did it become too late if you were Jewish

02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:27.610
to leave Germany you know and where would I go if I did leave if I became a

02:03:27.610 --> 02:03:33.130
refugee because of the hate being the center of the country and not just

02:03:33.130 --> 02:03:43.150
wackos like it is now very scary absolutely yeah oh my goodness uh Dallas

02:03:43.150 --> 02:03:49.390
thank you so much well thank I could talk to you for a few more hours um

02:03:49.390 --> 02:03:52.510
and I hope that I get that opportunity too because we didn't even go

02:03:52.510 --> 02:03:55.150
through a quarter the I think we went through maybe a quarter of the

02:03:55.150 --> 02:03:59.970
questions I have for you um and I think that you have so much to share so

02:03:59.970 --> 02:04:04.050
thank you so much for doing this today and everything you've done so far I

02:04:04.050 --> 02:04:07.670
really appreciate it thank you and thank you for your time and in doing

02:04:07.670 --> 02:04:12.090
this interview and anytime you want to follow up yeah I'm retired it's easy

02:04:12.090 --> 02:04:19.390
to do yay here's to retirement thank you bye bye Penelope bye Morna
