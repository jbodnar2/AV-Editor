Okay. All right. I heard that. It's the Thursday sigh. One more day. Yeah,

there we go. The Thursday sigh. It's Thursday, July 25th.

00:15.540 --> 00:20.320
President Biden explained his decision to step aside in a speech from the

00:20.320 --> 00:24.880
Oval Office. I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch for a

00:24.880 --> 00:28.620
new generation. What's on the agenda for his remaining time in office? I'm

00:34.760 --> 00:39.300
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets President Biden today and

00:39.300 --> 00:43.320
will meet separately with Vice President Harris, where do the President and

00:43.320 --> 00:47.460
Vice President differ on Israel and Gaza? And voters are paying attention

00:47.460 --> 00:51.480
to how Kamala Harris' record on law enforcement could play out in a contest

00:51.480 --> 00:56.200
against Donald Trump. When you can say this is a clear case of a prosecutor

00:56.200 --> 01:00.580
against a felon, it's a home run. Stay with us. We'll give you the news you

02:17.160 --> 02:20.580
Biden did not want to end his bid for reelection, but he said the stakes

02:20.580 --> 02:26.220
were just too high to risk it. I believe I reckon as president, my

02:26.220 --> 02:31.920
leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all married at a

02:31.920 --> 02:37.520
second term, but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our

02:37.520 --> 02:43.480
democracy. That includes personal ambition. So I've decided the best way

02:43.480 --> 02:48.040
forward is to pass the torch for a new generation. The president spoke of

02:48.040 --> 02:52.600
his decision to step aside and also asserted that he still has work to do

02:52.600 --> 02:56.740
in his final six months behind the Oval Office desk from which he addressed

02:56.740 --> 03:00.180
the nation. Joining us now to talk more about this is NPR senior White

03:00.180 --> 03:04.200
House correspondent Tamra Keith up again early after a long night, Tam.

03:04.780 --> 03:08.620
Yeah, good morning. Thanks for doing that. So what was Biden trying to

03:08.620 --> 03:13.060
accomplish with this address? Well, this was a monumental moment for Biden,

03:13.300 --> 03:16.940
marking the end or at least the beginning of the end of a very long career

03:16.940 --> 03:21.660
in public life. And his family sat lining the walls of the Oval Office as

03:21.660 --> 03:26.620
he spoke. The first lady, his grandkids, his kids, he spoke as Steve said

03:26.620 --> 03:30.280
from behind the resolute desk, this place of very serious presidential

03:30.280 --> 03:34.360
addresses. And this was about explaining the very difficult decision he

03:34.360 --> 03:39.000
made to step aside and putting it in a noble light. He was also making an

03:39.000 --> 03:42.560
appeal to the American people to think about what kind of country they

03:42.560 --> 03:46.340
want. At the very end, Biden delivered this emotional expression of

03:46.340 --> 03:49.880
gratitude, saying that he had given his heart and soul to the nation over

03:49.880 --> 03:54.120
50 years in public life and has been blessed with the love and support of

03:54.120 --> 03:58.620
the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of

03:58.620 --> 04:05.180
you. The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not

04:05.180 --> 04:09.880
rule, the people do. This wasn't the place for the overtly political

04:09.880 --> 04:13.800
language you would hear at a campaign rally. So he never said former

04:13.800 --> 04:18.220
President Trump's name, but the subtext was quite clear. It was clear, but

04:18.220 --> 04:21.480
you know the speech had the feeling of a farewell address, Tam, but he

04:21.480 --> 04:24.980
still has six months left in office. What did he say he wants to do at the

04:24.980 --> 04:28.760
time he is left? You know, it really felt like the oxygen drained out of

04:28.760 --> 04:31.480
his presidency when he announced he was dropping out of the race for

04:31.480 --> 04:35.740
reelection. But practically speaking, this term was already in a lame duck

04:35.740 --> 04:40.060
phase. His biggest achievements happened before Democrats lost control of

04:40.060 --> 04:44.340
the House in 2023. So a lot of what he can do in these final months is

04:44.340 --> 04:48.360
implementation, distributing funds for infrastructure and climate projects,

04:48.720 --> 04:52.320
cementing regulations. He said he is going to keep fighting for

04:52.320 --> 04:55.420
reproductive rights and civil rights. He's going to keep working on the

04:55.420 --> 04:59.560
economy and trying to lower costs and he'll speak out against extremism and

04:59.560 --> 05:03.600
political violence. And of course, he is still trying very hard to get a

05:03.600 --> 05:07.440
ceasefire for hostages deal in Gaza. Tam, we have a lot of time to talk

05:07.440 --> 05:10.320
about this, but at the end of the day, how do you think his legacy will be

05:10.320 --> 05:13.780
defined? Well, you know, there's been a lot of praise from Democrats about

05:13.780 --> 05:17.700
Biden's selflessness since his announcement on Sunday, but the real

05:17.700 --> 05:21.620
judgment comes in November. By realizing he needed to step aside at this

05:21.620 --> 05:26.120
very late date, he foreclosed any possibility of a real primary. Right now,

05:26.160 --> 05:29.380
Democrats are very excited about Vice President Harris as the likely

05:29.380 --> 05:33.620
nominee, but this race is still very close. If Harris wins, Biden will be

05:33.620 --> 05:36.980
remembered as the rare president who put his party and country ahead of his

05:36.980 --> 05:41.220
ego. If she loses, then he is both the person who removed Trump from office

05:41.220 --> 05:45.720
and ushered him back in. That is N.P.S. Tamara Keith waking up early again

05:45.720 --> 05:48.640
after another late night. Tam, thank you. You're welcome.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.780
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the U.S. Congress again

06:00.780 --> 06:05.220
yesterday. He's given addresses to Congress four different times, which is

06:05.220 --> 06:08.620
more than any foreign leader in history. He's been around for a while.

06:09.220 --> 06:13.860
Netanyahu's latest yesterday included flourishes often seen in a

06:13.860 --> 06:17.420
presidential state-of-the-union address. He told stories of guests in the

06:17.420 --> 06:22.400
audience to illustrate and defend Israel's war against Hamas. For the

06:22.400 --> 06:28.360
forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.760
Today, the Prime Minister meets President Biden at the White House and also

06:32.760 --> 06:38.120
meets with Vice President Harris how she engages Netanyahu matters more now

06:38.120 --> 06:41.520
that she's running for president. NPR White House correspondent Asma Khaled

06:41.520 --> 06:44.380
is with us now to tell us more about that. Good morning, Asma. Good

06:44.380 --> 06:47.740
morning. I wanted to ask you how you characterize the Vice President's

06:47.740 --> 06:50.720
policies on Gaza. I mean, obviously, she's the Vice President, so you

06:50.720 --> 06:55.840
assume that her policies would have to be in lockstep with the presidents.

06:56.520 --> 07:00.380
But what would you say about how she approaches the issue? Well, the

07:00.380 --> 07:03.960
substance of what she's saying is similar to Biden, but she differs in

07:03.960 --> 07:08.800
style and tone. Harris did describe her as having a, quote, unwavering

07:08.800 --> 07:12.580
commitment to the security of Israel. I also talked with an advisor from

07:12.580 --> 07:16.080
Harris's days in the Senate, Hailey Soyfer, who told me what it was like at

07:16.080 --> 07:19.100
a recent White House event in which she saw the Vice President take on a

07:19.100 --> 07:22.620
real leadership role in condemning the use of sexual violence in the

07:22.620 --> 07:26.100
October 7th attacks. But really, Michelle, the real difference from Biden

07:26.100 --> 07:30.200
is how Harris talks about people in Gaza. Take a listen to her comments

07:30.200 --> 07:34.780
from this past March in Selma, Alabama. What we are seeing every day in

07:34.780 --> 07:41.400
Gaza is devastating. We have seen reports of families eating leaves or

07:41.400 --> 07:49.140
animal feed. Women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no

07:49.140 --> 07:52.840
medical care. I've spoken with multiple people who've remarked to me that

07:52.840 --> 07:57.200
Harris shows a greater degree of empathy for Palestinian civilians than

07:57.200 --> 08:01.200
they have heard publicly from Biden. Have these words affected how voters

08:01.200 --> 08:05.720
see her? Well, people I've spoken with in the Arab-American community say

08:05.720 --> 08:10.660
that Harris is not viewed as being as toxic as Biden. I was speaking to

08:10.660 --> 08:14.580
Rubel Roman. She's a Democratic Georgia state legislator, a Palestinian

08:14.580 --> 08:18.200
American, and she put it this way. I can tell you right now that if I had,

08:18.300 --> 08:22.400
for example, tried to go to a mosque or Arab community event and urged them

08:22.400 --> 08:26.620
to vote for Joe Biden, I would never be invited back. The anger was so deep

08:26.620 --> 08:31.880
and the hurt was so deep. Even for me, I tell people that. And I think

08:31.880 --> 08:35.980
people would at least be open to hearing from her and to let her make her

08:35.980 --> 08:40.180
case. And some Democrats who voted uncommitted during the primaries told me

08:40.180 --> 08:42.980
that they're willing to give Harris a chance. I mean, to be clear, they are

08:42.980 --> 08:46.520
not saying they will definitively vote for her, but there's a possibility.

08:47.140 --> 08:50.100
I'll also say that Harris was one of the earlier people in the

08:50.100 --> 08:53.580
administration to show a less dismissive response to some of the protests

08:53.580 --> 08:56.900
here at home. Today, she is meeting separately with Israel's Prime

08:56.900 --> 09:01.440
Minister, separately from Biden. What do you expect from her meeting? What

09:01.440 --> 09:04.740
I'm watching for is how closely she sticks to the president. You know, she

09:04.740 --> 09:08.040
inherits this problem now in her campaign and following the attack in

09:08.040 --> 09:12.420
October that killed more than 1,200 people. There are now more than 39,000

09:12.420 --> 09:15.920
Palestinians who've been killed and there's still no ceasefire. And some

09:15.920 --> 09:19.200
people will blame her because she is a part of this administration. She has

09:19.200 --> 09:23.440
a real delicate balancing act where she's going to try not to alienate

09:23.440 --> 09:27.500
supporters of Israel who make up a key part of the Democratic Party, but

09:27.500 --> 09:30.940
she's also trying to win back some of the young, progressive, brown and

09:30.940 --> 09:34.320
black voters whom Biden alienated with some of his decisions about this

09:34.320 --> 09:38.640
war. That is NPR's Asma Khaled. Asma, thank you. Good to talk to you.

09:47.060 --> 09:50.580
Vice President Harris faces another fundamental challenge to win the

09:50.580 --> 09:54.480
election. The likely Democratic nominee will have to hold together a broad

09:54.480 --> 09:57.280
coalition, and they have some very different views on some issues.

09:57.700 --> 10:01.920
President Biden managed this in 2020, but the coalition has frayed as we've

10:01.920 --> 10:05.160
just heard, and Harris is a different figure. Her challenge becomes plain

10:05.160 --> 10:08.480
what comes to her record in law enforcement. My co-host Steve Inskeep has

10:08.480 --> 10:11.140
been talking with voters in western Pennsylvania. Steve, what did you find

10:11.140 --> 10:15.400
out? Well, some contrasting opinions of a big part of Harris's resume. Her

10:15.400 --> 10:19.740
history as a San Francisco prosecutor in California Attorney General. She

10:19.740 --> 10:24.720
raised this in her first campaign event while running for president talking

10:24.720 --> 10:28.800
of Donald Trump and saying, as a prosecutor, she knew what a predator was

10:28.800 --> 10:34.220
or a fraudster. How voters take that message depends on who you talk to. On

10:34.220 --> 10:38.540
NPR's Morning Edition yesterday, we heard Kathleen Madonna Emerling, a

10:38.540 --> 10:42.660
Democratic Party activist in the Pittsburgh suburbs, who really likes her

10:42.660 --> 10:48.460
new candidate. My first thought was, this is the ideal suburban candidate

10:48.460 --> 10:55.900
because she straddles the line between being approachable, relatable,

10:56.600 --> 11:01.440
joyful event, while also having incredible public safety credentials.

11:01.800 --> 11:07.980
Because often in the suburbs, people want someone who is pro-public safety,

11:08.280 --> 11:12.900
pro-police. Because many people in her suburb have military or police

11:12.900 --> 11:17.460
backgrounds. And when you can say, this is a clear case of a prosecutor

11:17.460 --> 11:21.760
against a felon, it's a home run. Although for some people in the

11:21.760 --> 11:25.020
Democratic Coalition, Michelle, this is a more complicated subject. And I

11:25.020 --> 11:29.160
can co-sign that because I have, as they say, people of that way where you

11:29.160 --> 11:33.840
are. So what is another way people see the vice president's record? As a

11:33.840 --> 11:38.320
potential mark against her. I also went into central Pittsburgh this week

11:38.320 --> 11:41.960
to the Hill District, which is a historically black neighborhood, and

11:41.960 --> 11:46.120
talked with Adrienne Dilworth. She said she had mixed feelings about

11:46.120 --> 11:50.980
Harris. We spoke here while dodging cars in a grocery store parking lot. I

11:50.980 --> 11:55.820
think they should have put out a broader net for candidates to see who

11:55.820 --> 11:59.800
could be actually the best and not just, you know, like, okay, we're just

11:59.800 --> 12:03.780
going to push the VP for the position. Why do you have mixed feelings about

12:03.780 --> 12:09.580
vice president Harris? Just some of her history. We better get away from

12:09.580 --> 12:14.600
this. It would be bad for the interview if you run over in the middle here.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.980
Yeah, no, we're not going to have that. From just some of what I'm hearing

12:17.980 --> 12:22.260
from what of her history of some of the people that she's had incarcerated

12:22.260 --> 12:27.180
in the past. She was referring to part of Harris' record as a prosecutor.

12:27.440 --> 12:31.040
She fought to put people in prison. Sometimes she clashed with civil rights

12:31.040 --> 12:34.360
groups and activists over her decisions. And she's been attacked over the

12:34.360 --> 12:38.660
years on the left for this. Now the attack is being repeated by

12:38.660 --> 12:42.540
Republicans. I guess you could say that Republicans are just trolling here,

12:42.540 --> 12:46.600
but they are also explicitly seeking some of the black vote for Donald

12:46.600 --> 12:50.160
Trump. And you can see where that might resonate with some people in a

12:50.160 --> 12:53.480
community that has had this complicated, as you say, relationship with law

12:53.480 --> 12:56.440
enforcement. Oh, yeah, I've interviewed people in that same neighborhood in

12:56.440 --> 13:00.300
past years, and I once met a voter who was 22 and said she'd already been

13:00.300 --> 13:05.220
jailed twice for things that she said she didn't do. So to hold together

13:05.220 --> 13:08.720
that Democratic coalition, Harris needs law and order people and also

13:08.720 --> 13:12.280
people who are skeptical of law and order as it is sometimes practiced in

13:12.280 --> 13:15.900
the United States, and we can expect her record to be scrutinized. Although

13:15.900 --> 13:18.760
I should add in that same neighborhood, I also found people who were very

13:18.760 --> 13:21.940
eager to vote for Harris, excited to vote for a woman, and they were

13:21.940 --> 13:25.980
organizing with a new intensity. That is Steve Inskiep in Pittsburgh.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.460
Steve, thank you. Glad to do it.

13:32.020 --> 13:36.400
And that's up first for Thursday, July 25th. I'm Michelle Martin. And I'm

13:36.400 --> 13:40.240
Steve Inskiep. Consider this. Kamala Harris will not be the first woman to

13:40.240 --> 13:43.680
lead a major party's presidential ticket, but will be the first woman of

13:43.680 --> 13:47.460
color. And though her nomination is not yet official, she's already the

13:47.460 --> 13:52.060
subject of racist attacks. How does that affect her candidacy? Listen to

13:52.060 --> 13:56.100
consider this. Today's episode of Up First was edited by Roberta Rampton,

13:56.320 --> 14:00.400
