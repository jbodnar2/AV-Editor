1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay. All right. I heard that. It's the Thursday sigh. One more day.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yeah, there we go. The Thursday sigh. It's Thursday, July 25th.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
President Biden explained his decision to step aside in a speech from the Oval Office.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch for a new generation.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What's on the agenda for his remaining time in office?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm Stephen Skeep with Michelle Martin, and this is up first from NPR News.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets President Biden today

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and will meet separately with Vice President Harris,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
where do the President and Vice President differ on Israel and Gaza?

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And voters are paying attention to how Kamala Harris' record on law enforcement

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
could play out in a contest against Donald Trump.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And you can say, this is a clear case of a prosecutor against a felon.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's a home run.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000

who saved with Progressive between June 2022 and May 2023.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
President Biden did not want to end his bid for reelection,

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
but he said the stakes were just too high to risk it.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I believe I reckon as president, my leadership in the world,

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
my vision for America's future, all married at a second term,

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That includes personal ambition.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The president spoke of his decision to step aside

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and also asserted that he still has work to do

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
in his final six months behind the Oval Office desk

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
from which he addressed the nation.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Joining us now to talk more about this

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
is NPR Senior White House correspondent Tamra Keith

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
up again early after a long night, Tam.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, good morning.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Thanks for doing that.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So what was Biden trying to accomplish with this address?

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, this was a monumental moment for Biden marking the end

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
or at least the beginning of the end of a very long career in public life.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And his family sat lining the walls of the Oval Office as he spoke.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The First Lady, his grandkids, his kids,

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
he spoke as Steve said from behind the Resolute Desk,

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
this place of very serious presidential addresses.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And this was about explaining the very difficult decision

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
he made to step aside and putting it in a noble light.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He was also making an appeal to the American people

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
to think about what kind of country they want.

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
At the very end, Biden delivered this emotional expression of gratitude

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
saying that he had given his heart and soul to the nation

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
over 50 years in public life

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and has been blessed with the love and support of the American people.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The great thing about America is here,

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
kings and dictators do not rule, the people do.

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This wasn't the place for the overtly political language

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
you would hear at a campaign rally.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So he never said former President Trump's name,

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
but the subtext was quite clear.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It was clear, but, you know, the speech had the feeling of a farewell address,

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
but he still has six months left in office.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What did he say he wants to do at the time he is left?

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You know, it really felt like the oxygen drained out of his presidency

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
when he announced he was dropping out of the race for reelection.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But practically speaking, this term was already in a lame duck phase.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
His biggest achievements happened before Democrats lost control of the House in 2023.

73
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So a lot of what he can do in these final months is implementation,

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
distributing funds for infrastructure and climate projects, cementing regulations.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He said he is going to keep fighting for reproductive rights and civil rights.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He's going to keep working on the economy and trying to lower costs

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and he'll speak out against extremism and political violence.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And of course, he is still trying very hard to get a ceasefire for hostage's deal in Gaza.

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Tam, we have a lot of time to talk about this, but at the end of the day,

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
how do you think his legacy will be defined?

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, you know, there's been a lot of praise from Democrats about Biden's selflessness

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
since his announcement on Sunday, but the real judgment comes in November.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
By realizing he needed to step aside at this very late date,

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
he foreclosed any possibility of a real primary.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Right now, Democrats are very excited about Vice President Harris as the likely nominee,

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but this race is still very close.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If Harris wins, Biden will be remembered as the rare president

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
who put his party and country ahead of his ego.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If she loses, then he is both the person who removed Trump from office

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and ushered him back in.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That is N.P.S. Tamara Keith waking up early again after another late night.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Tam, thank you.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're welcome.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the U.S. Congress again yesterday.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He's given addresses to Congress four different times,

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
which is more than any foreign leader in history.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He's been around for a while.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Netanyahu's latest yesterday included flourishes,

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
often seen in a presidential state of the union address.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
There are stories of guests in the audience to illustrate

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and defend Israel's war against Hamas.

102
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
For the forces of civilization to triumph,

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
America and Israel must stand together.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Today, the Prime Minister meets President Biden at the White House

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and also meets with Vice President Harris

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
how she engages Netanyahu matters more now that she's running for president.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
NPR White House correspondent Asma Khaled is with us now to tell us more about that.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Good morning, Asma.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Good morning.

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I wanted to ask you how you characterize the Vice President's policies on Gaza.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Obviously, she's the Vice President,

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
so you assume that her policies would have to be in lockstep with the presidents.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But what would you say about how she approaches the issue?

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Well, the substance of what she's saying is similar to Biden,

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
but she differs in style and tone.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Harris did describe her as having a, quote,

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
unwavering commitment to the security of Israel.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I also talked with an advisor from Harris's days in the Senate,

119
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and she's the only soy for who told me what it was like at a recent White House event

120
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
in which she saw the Vice President take on a real leadership role

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
in condemning the use of sexual violence in the October 7th attacks.

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But really, Michelle, the real difference from Biden

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
is how Harris talks about people in Gaza.

124
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Take a listen to her comments from this past March in Selma, Alabama.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed.

127
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care.

128
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I've spoken with multiple people who've remarked to me

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
that Harris shows a greater degree of empathy for Palestinian civilians

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
than they have heard publicly from Biden.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Have these words affected how voters see her?

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, people I've spoken with in the Arab-American community

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
say that Harris is not viewed as being as toxic as Biden.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I was speaking to Rubel Roman.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
She's a Democratic Georgia State Legislator, a Palestinian American,

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and she put it this way.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I can tell you right now that if I had, for example,

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
tried to go to a mosque or Arab community event

139
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
and urged them to vote for Joe Biden, I would never be invited back.

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The anger was so deep and the hurt was so deep.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Even for me, I tell people that.

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And I think people would at least be open to hearing from her

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and to let her make her case.

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And some Democrats who voted uncommitted during the primaries

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
told me that they're willing to give Harris a chance.

146
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I mean, to be clear, they are not saying they will definitively vote for her,

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
but there's a possibility.

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll also say that Harris was one of the earlier people in the administration

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
to show a less dismissive response to some of the protests here at home.

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Today, she is meeting separately with Israel's Prime Minister,

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
separately from Biden.

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What do you expect from her meeting?

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What I'm watching for is how closely she sticks to the president.

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You know, she inherits this problem now in her campaign.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And following the attack in October that killed more than 1,200 people,

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
there are now more than 39,000 Palestinians who've been killed.

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And there's still no ceasefire.

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And some people will blame her because she is a part of this administration.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
She has a real delicate balancing act,

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
where she's going to try not to alienate supporters of Israel,

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
who make up a key part of the Democratic Party,

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
but she's also trying to win back some of the young, progressive, brown and black voters

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
whom Biden alienated with some of his decisions about this war.

164
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That is NPO's Asma Khaled. Asma, thank you.

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Good to talk to you.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Vice President Harris faces another fundamental challenge.

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
To win the election, the likely Democratic nominee will have to hold together a broad coalition.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And they have some very different views on some issues.

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
President Biden managed this in 2020, but the coalition has frayed,

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
as we've just heard, and Harris is a different figure.

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Her challenge becomes plain what comes to her record in law enforcement.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
My co-host Steve Inskeep has been talking with voters in western Pennsylvania.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Steve, what did you find out?

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Well, some contrasting opinions of a big part of Harris's resume.

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Her history as a San Francisco prosecutor and California attorney general.

176
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
She raised this in her first campaign event while running for president,

177
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
talking of Donald Trump and saying as a prosecutor,

178
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
she knew what a predator was or a fraudster.

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
How voters take that message depends on who you talk to.

180
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
On NPR's morning edition yesterday, we heard Kathleen Madonna Emerling,

181
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
a Democratic Party activist in the Pittsburgh suburbs,

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
who really likes her new candidate.

183
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
My first thought was this is the ideal suburban candidate

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
because she straddles the line between being approachable,

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
relatable, joyful even, while also having incredible public safety credentials.

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Because often in the suburbs, people want someone who is pro-public safety, pro-police.

187
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because many people in her suburb have military or police backgrounds.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And when you can say this is a clear case of a prosecutor against a felon,

189
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
it's a home run.

190
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Although for some people in the Democratic Coalition, Michelle, this is a more complicated subject.

191
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And I can co-sign that because I have, as they say, people of that way where you are.

192
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
So what is another way people see the vice president's record?

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
As a potential mark against her.

194
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I also went into central Pittsburgh this week to the Hill District,

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
which is a historically black neighborhood, and talked with Adrienne Dilworth.

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
She said she had mixed feelings about Harris.

197
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We spoke here while dodging cars in a grocery store parking lot.

198
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I think they should have put out a broader net for candidates to see who could be actually the best

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and not just, you know, like, okay, we're just going to push the VP for the position.

200
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Why do you have mixed feelings about Vice President Harris?

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Just some of her history.

202
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We better get away from this.

203
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It would be bad for the interview if you run over in the middle here.

204
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, no, we're not going to have that.

205
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,000
From just some of what I'm hearing from her history of some of the people that she's had incarcerated in the past.

206
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
She was referring to part of Harris' record as a prosecutor.

207
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
She fought to put people in prison.

208
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Sometimes she clashed with civil rights groups and activists over her decisions.

209
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And she's been attacked over the years on the left for this.

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Now the attack is being repeated by Republicans.

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I guess you could say that Republicans are just trolling here, but they are also explicitly seeking some of the black vote for Donald Trump.

212
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And you can see where that might resonate with some people in a community that has had this complicated, as you say, relationship with law enforcement.

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh yeah, I've interviewed people in that same neighborhood in past years and I once met a voter who was 22 and said she'd already been jailed twice for things that she said she didn't do.

214
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So to hold together that Democratic coalition, Harris needs law and order people and also people who are skeptical of law and order as it is sometimes practiced in the United States.

215
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And we can expect her record to be scrutinized.

216
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Although I should add in that same neighborhood, I also found people who were very eager to vote for Harris, excited to vote for a woman.

217
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And they were organizing with a new intensity.

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That is Steve Inskiep in Pittsburgh.

219
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Steve, thank you.

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Glad to do it.

221
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And that's up first for Thursday, July 25th.

222
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm Michelle Martin.

223
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And I'm Steve Inskiep.

224
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Consider this.

225
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Kamala Harris will not be the first woman to lead a major party's presidential ticket, but will be the first woman of color.

226
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And though her nomination is not yet official, she's already the subject of racist attacks.

227
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
How does that affect her candidacy?

228
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Listen to consider this.

229
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Today's episode of Up First was edited by Roberta Rampton, Gabriel Spitzer, Dana Farrington, Janea Williams, and Alice Wolfley.
