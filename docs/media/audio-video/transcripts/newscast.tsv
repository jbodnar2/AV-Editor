15540	20920	President Biden explained his decision to step aside in a speech from the Oval Office.

42200	45780	where do the President and Vice President differ on Israel and Gaza?
46060	49940	And voters are paying attention to how Kamala Harris' record on law enforcement
49940	52600	could play out in a contest against Donald Trump.
52860	57240	When you can say this is a clear case of a prosecutor against a felon,

134600	136060	Potential savings will vary.
136660	139700	President Biden did not want to end his bid for reelection,
139700	142260	but he said the stakes were just too high to risk it.
142520	147260	I believe I reckon as president, my leadership in the world,
148240	152500	my vision for America's future, all married at a second term,
153540	158080	but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy.
158960	160600	That includes personal ambition.
160600	166560	So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch for a new generation.
167160	169600	The president spoke of his decision to step aside
169600	172600	and also asserted that he still has work to do
172600	175680	in his final six months behind the Oval Office desk
175680	177200	from which he addressed the nation.
177420	179080	Joining us now to talk more about this
179080	181680	is NPR senior White House correspondent Tamra Keith
181680	184200	up again early after a long night, Tam.
184780	185600	Yeah, good morning.
185840	186520	Thanks for doing that.
186520	189840	So what was Biden trying to accomplish with this address?
190540	193060	Well, this was a monumental moment for Biden,
193300	195780	marking the end or at least the beginning of the end
195780	197800	of a very long career in public life.
198100	202080	And his family sat lining the walls of the Oval Office as he spoke.
202500	204660	The first lady, his grandkids, his kids,
205280	208060	he spoke as Steve said from behind the resolute desk,
208180	210940	this place of very serious presidential addresses.
211440	214140	And this was about explaining the very difficult decision
214140	215400	he made to step aside
215400	217640	and putting it in a noble light.
217980	220320	He was also making an appeal to the American people
220320	222900	to think about what kind of country they want.
223380	224340	At the very end,
224460	226720	Biden delivered this emotional expression of gratitude,
226720	229620	saying that he had given his heart and soul to the nation
229620	231320	over 50 years in public life
231320	233820	and has been blessed with the love and support
233820	235000	of the American people.
235300	238780	I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.
240220	242920	The great thing about America is here,
243500	246840	kings and dictators do not rule, the people do.
247260	250380	This wasn't the place for the overtly political language
250380	251800	you would hear at a campaign rally.
252140	254880	So he never said former President Trump's name,
254940	257080	but the subtext was quite clear.
257380	258040	It was clear,
258080	260940	but you know the speech had the feeling of a farewell address,
261100	262940	Tam, but he still has six months left in office.
263400	265660	What did he say he wants to do at the time he is left?
266420	269360	You know, it really felt like the oxygen drained out of his presidency
269360	271960	when he announced he was dropping out of the race for reelection.
271960	276060	But practically speaking, this term was already in a lame duck phase.
276540	278240	His biggest achievements happened
278240	281100	before Democrats lost control of the House in 2023.
281420	284960	So a lot of what he can do in these final months is implementation,
285380	288360	distributing funds for infrastructure and climate projects,
288720	289780	cementing regulations.
290440	293300	He said he is going to keep fighting for reproductive rights
293300	294060	and civil rights.
294240	297280	He's going to keep working on the economy and trying to lower costs
297280	300440	and he'll speak out against extremism and political violence.
300440	304100	And of course, he is still trying very hard to get a ceasefire
304100	305840	for hostages deal in Gaza.
306100	307900	Tam, we have a lot of time to talk about this,
307940	310740	but at the end of the day, how do you think his legacy will be defined?
311400	313380	Well, you know, there's been a lot of praise from Democrats
313380	316880	about Biden's selflessness since his announcement on Sunday,
316880	318920	but the real judgment comes in November.
319300	322400	By realizing he needed to step aside at this very late date,
322580	325140	he foreclosed any possibility of a real primary.
325700	328780	Right now, Democrats are very excited about Vice President Harris
328780	331620	as the likely nominee, but this race is still very close.
332400	334860	If Harris wins, Biden will be remembered as the rare president
334860	337240	who put his party and country ahead of his ego.
337720	341220	If she loses, then he is both the person who removed Trump from office
341220	342720	and ushered him back in.
343080	347000	That is N.P.S. Tamara Keith waking up early again after another late night.
347160	347780	Tam, thank you.
348120	348640	You're welcome.
356800	361340	Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the U.S. Congress again yesterday.
361780	364740	He's given addresses to Congress four different times,
364880	367400	which is more than any foreign leader in history.
367560	368620	He's been around for a while.
369220	372540	Netanyahu's latest yesterday included flourishes
372540	375480	often seen in a presidential state-of-the-union address.
375480	378980	He told stories of guests in the audience to illustrate
378980	381660	and defend Israel's war against Hamas.
382020	384320	For the forces of civilization to triumph,
385060	388360	America and Israel must stand together.
389420	392020	Today, the Prime Minister meets President Biden at the White House
392020	394560	and also meets with Vice President Harris
394560	399240	how she engages Netanyahu matters more now that she's running for president.
399440	403080	NPR White House correspondent Asma Khaled is with us now to tell us more about that.
403200	403800	Good morning, Asma.
404240	404680	Good morning.
404680	408600	I wanted to ask you how you characterize the Vice President's policies on Gaza.
408840	410360	I mean, obviously, she's the Vice President,
410480	415840	so you assume that her policies would have to be in lockstep with the presidents.
416520	419260	But what would you say about how she approaches the issue?
420100	422800	Well, the substance of what she's saying is similar to Biden,
422920	425100	but she differs in style and tone.
425560	427920	Harris did describe her as having a, quote,
428100	430580	unwavering commitment to the security of Israel.
430580	434400	I also talked with an advisor from Harris's days in the Senate, Hailey Soyfer,
434700	437220	who told me what it was like at a recent White House event
437220	440060	in which she saw the Vice President take on a real leadership role
440060	443640	in condemning the use of sexual violence in the October 7th attacks.
443940	446100	But really, Michelle, the real difference from Biden
446100	448460	is how Harris talks about people in Gaza.
449040	451960	Take a listen to her comments from this past March in Selma, Alabama.
452440	456220	What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating.
456220	462180	We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed.
463180	469860	Women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care.
470380	472660	I've spoken with multiple people who've remarked to me
472660	476680	that Harris shows a greater degree of empathy for Palestinian civilians
476680	478500	than they have heard publicly from Biden.
479040	481700	Have these words affected how voters see her?
482260	485380	Well, people I've spoken with in the Arab-American community
485380	489100	say that Harris is not viewed as being as toxic as Biden.
489480	491500	I was speaking to Rubel Roman.
491720	495020	She's a Democratic Georgia state legislator, a Palestinian American,
495120	496220	and she put it this way.
496480	498660	I can tell you right now that if I had, for example,
498760	501620	tried to go to a mosque or Arab community event
501620	503220	and urged them to vote for Joe Biden,
503360	504740	I would never be invited back.
505260	508160	The anger was so deep and the hurt was so deep.
508440	510300	Even for me, I tell people that.
511060	514400	And I think people would at least be open to hearing from her
514400	516300	and to let her make her case.
516640	519640	And some Democrats who voted uncommitted during the primaries
519640	521960	told me that they're willing to give Harris a chance.
522140	525340	I mean, to be clear, they are not saying they will definitively vote for her,
525340	526520	but there's a possibility.
527140	530500	I'll also say that Harris was one of the earlier people in the administration
530500	534160	to show a less dismissive response to some of the protests here at home.
534460	537200	Today, she is meeting separately with Israel's Prime Minister,
537560	538380	separately from Biden.
538540	540140	What do you expect from her meeting?
540980	544200	What I'm watching for is how closely she sticks to the president.
544500	546780	You know, she inherits this problem now in her campaign
546780	550440	and following the attack in October that killed more than 1,200 people.
550660	553700	There are now more than 39,000 Palestinians who've been killed
553700	555560	and there's still no ceasefire.
555700	558420	And some people will blame her because she is a part of this administration.
558840	561200	She has a real delicate balancing act
561200	564240	where she's going to try not to alienate supporters of Israel
564240	566620	who make up a key part of the Democratic Party,
566620	571500	but she's also trying to win back some of the young, progressive, brown and black voters
571500	574560	whom Biden alienated with some of his decisions about this war.
574900	577220	That is NPR's Asma Khaled. Asma, thank you.
577600	578640	Good to talk to you.
587060	590960	Vice President Harris faces another fundamental challenge to win the election.
591340	595040	The likely Democratic nominee will have to hold together a broad coalition,
595040	597280	and they have some very different views on some issues.
597700	601240	President Biden managed this in 2020, but the coalition has frayed
601240	603740	as we've just heard, and Harris is a different figure.
604320	606760	Her challenge becomes plain what comes to her record in law enforcement.
607160	610220	My co-host Steve Inskeep has been talking with voters in western Pennsylvania.
610220	611360	Steve, what did you find out?
611840	615100	Well, some contrasting opinions of a big part of Harris's resume.
615360	619400	Her history as a San Francisco prosecutor in California Attorney General.
619560	623360	She raised this in her first campaign event
623360	626280	while running for president talking of Donald Trump and saying,
626640	629780	as a prosecutor, she knew what a predator was or a fraudster.
630560	633860	How voters take that message depends on who you talk to.
634060	637940	On NPR's Morning Edition yesterday, we heard Kathleen Madonna Emerling,
638400	641420	a Democratic Party activist in the Pittsburgh suburbs,
641600	643140	who really likes her new candidate.
643500	648460	My first thought was, this is the ideal suburban candidate
648460	654460	because she straddles the line between being approachable,
655500	661440	relatable, joyful event, while also having incredible public safety credentials.
661800	668860	Because often in the suburbs, people want someone who is pro-public safety, pro-police.
669320	673500	Because many people in her suburb have military or police backgrounds.
673500	679800	And when you can say, this is a clear case of a prosecutor against a felon, it's a home run.
680240	684560	Although for some people in the Democratic Coalition, Michelle, this is a more complicated subject.
684720	689420	And I can co-sign that because I have, as they say, people of that way where you are.
690000	692580	So what is another way people see the vice president's record?
693020	695720	As a potential mark against her.
696020	699260	I also went into central Pittsburgh this week to the Hill District,
699260	703160	which is a historically black neighborhood, and talked with Adrienne Dilworth.
703600	706480	She said she had mixed feelings about Harris.
706720	710560	We spoke here while dodging cars in a grocery store parking lot.
710820	717340	I think they should have put out a broader net for candidates to see who could be actually the best
717340	721860	and not just, you know, like, okay, we're just going to push the VP for the position.
722180	725180	Why do you have mixed feelings about vice president Harris?
726200	727660	Just some of her history.
728220	729800	We better get away from this.
731480	734600	It would be bad for the interview if you run over in the middle here.
734600	735820	Yeah, no, we're not going to have that.
736360	743260	From just some of what I'm hearing from what of her history of some of the people that she's had incarcerated in the past.
744180	747180	She was referring to part of Harris' record as a prosecutor.
747440	748780	She fought to put people in prison.
749120	752840	Sometimes she clashed with civil rights groups and activists over her decisions.
752840	756360	And she's been attacked over the years on the left for this.
756620	759300	Now the attack is being repeated by Republicans.
759920	762540	I guess you could say that Republicans are just trolling here,
762540	766880	but they are also explicitly seeking some of the black vote for Donald Trump.
767040	773820	And you can see where that might resonate with some people in a community that has had this complicated, as you say, relationship with law enforcement.
774160	777000	Oh, yeah, I've interviewed people in that same neighborhood in past years,
777000	783600	and I once met a voter who was 22 and said she'd already been jailed twice for things that she said she didn't do.
784360	787940	So to hold together that Democratic coalition, Harris needs law and order people
787940	792900	and also people who are skeptical of law and order as it is sometimes practiced in the United States,
792940	795100	and we can expect her record to be scrutinized.
795460	799800	Although I should add in that same neighborhood, I also found people who were very eager to vote for Harris,
800020	803340	excited to vote for a woman, and they were organizing with a new intensity.
803340	806840	That is Steve Inskiep in Pittsburgh. Steve, thank you.
807140	808460	Glad to do it.
812020	815660	And that's up first for Thursday, July 25th. I'm Michelle Martin.
816160	817800	And I'm Steve Inskiep. Consider this.
818180	821980	Kamala Harris will not be the first woman to lead a major party's presidential ticket,
822040	824080	but will be the first woman of color.
824500	829460	And though her nomination is not yet official, she's already the subject of racist attacks.
829940	832700	How does that affect her candidacy? Listen to consider this.
