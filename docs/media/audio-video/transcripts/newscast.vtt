00:00.000 --> 00:06.840
Okay. All right. I heard that. It's the Thursday sigh. One more day.

00:07.420 --> 00:11.180
Yeah, there we go. The Thursday sigh. It's Thursday, July 25th.

00:15.540 --> 00:20.920
President Biden explained his decision to step aside in a speech from the Oval Office.

00:21.220 --> 00:25.380
I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch for a new generation.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.120
What's on the agenda for his remaining time in office?

00:28.120 --> 00:32.260
I'm Stephen Skeep with Michelle Martin, and this is Up First from NPR News.

00:34.760 --> 00:38.640
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets President Biden today

00:38.640 --> 00:41.740
and will meet separately with Vice President Harris,

00:42.200 --> 00:45.780
where do the President and Vice President differ on Israel and Gaza?

00:46.060 --> 00:49.940
And voters are paying attention to how Kamala Harris' record on law enforcement

00:49.940 --> 00:52.600
could play out in a contest against Donald Trump.

00:52.860 --> 00:57.240
When you can say this is a clear case of a prosecutor against a felon,

00:57.240 --> 00:58.540
it's a home run.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.060
Potential savings will vary.

02:16.660 --> 02:19.700
President Biden did not want to end his bid for reelection,

02:19.700 --> 02:22.260
but he said the stakes were just too high to risk it.

02:22.520 --> 02:27.260
I believe I reckon as president, my leadership in the world,

02:28.240 --> 02:32.500
my vision for America's future, all married at a second term,

02:33.540 --> 02:38.080
but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.600
That includes personal ambition.

02:40.600 --> 02:46.560
So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch for a new generation.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.600
The president spoke of his decision to step aside

02:49.600 --> 02:52.600
and also asserted that he still has work to do

02:52.600 --> 02:55.680
in his final six months behind the Oval Office desk

02:55.680 --> 02:57.200
from which he addressed the nation.

02:57.420 --> 02:59.080
Joining us now to talk more about this

02:59.080 --> 03:01.680
is NPR senior White House correspondent Tamra Keith

03:01.680 --> 03:04.200
up again early after a long night, Tam.

03:04.780 --> 03:05.600
Yeah, good morning.

03:05.840 --> 03:06.520
Thanks for doing that.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.840
So what was Biden trying to accomplish with this address?

03:10.540 --> 03:13.060
Well, this was a monumental moment for Biden,

03:13.300 --> 03:15.780
marking the end or at least the beginning of the end

03:15.780 --> 03:17.800
of a very long career in public life.

03:18.100 --> 03:22.080
And his family sat lining the walls of the Oval Office as he spoke.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.660
The first lady, his grandkids, his kids,

03:25.280 --> 03:28.060
he spoke as Steve said from behind the resolute desk,

03:28.180 --> 03:30.940
this place of very serious presidential addresses.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.140
And this was about explaining the very difficult decision

03:34.140 --> 03:35.400
he made to step aside

03:35.400 --> 03:37.640
and putting it in a noble light.

03:37.980 --> 03:40.320
He was also making an appeal to the American people

03:40.320 --> 03:42.900
to think about what kind of country they want.

03:43.380 --> 03:44.340
At the very end,

03:44.460 --> 03:46.720
Biden delivered this emotional expression of gratitude,

03:46.720 --> 03:49.620
saying that he had given his heart and soul to the nation

03:49.620 --> 03:51.320
over 50 years in public life

03:51.320 --> 03:53.820
and has been blessed with the love and support

03:53.820 --> 03:55.000
of the American people.

03:55.300 --> 03:58.780
I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.

04:00.220 --> 04:02.920
The great thing about America is here,

04:03.500 --> 04:06.840
kings and dictators do not rule, the people do.

04:07.260 --> 04:10.380
This wasn't the place for the overtly political language

04:10.380 --> 04:11.800
you would hear at a campaign rally.

04:12.140 --> 04:14.880
So he never said former President Trump's name,

04:14.940 --> 04:17.080
but the subtext was quite clear.

04:17.380 --> 04:18.040
It was clear,

04:18.080 --> 04:20.940
but you know the speech had the feeling of a farewell address,

04:21.100 --> 04:22.940
Tam, but he still has six months left in office.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.660
What did he say he wants to do at the time he is left?

04:26.420 --> 04:29.360
You know, it really felt like the oxygen drained out of his presidency

04:29.360 --> 04:31.960
when he announced he was dropping out of the race for reelection.

04:31.960 --> 04:36.060
But practically speaking, this term was already in a lame duck phase.

04:36.540 --> 04:38.240
His biggest achievements happened

04:38.240 --> 04:41.100
before Democrats lost control of the House in 2023.

04:41.420 --> 04:44.960
So a lot of what he can do in these final months is implementation,

04:45.380 --> 04:48.360
distributing funds for infrastructure and climate projects,

04:48.720 --> 04:49.780
cementing regulations.

04:50.440 --> 04:53.300
He said he is going to keep fighting for reproductive rights

04:53.300 --> 04:54.060
and civil rights.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.280
He's going to keep working on the economy and trying to lower costs

04:57.280 --> 05:00.440
and he'll speak out against extremism and political violence.

05:00.440 --> 05:04.100
And of course, he is still trying very hard to get a ceasefire

05:04.100 --> 05:05.840
for hostages deal in Gaza.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.900
Tam, we have a lot of time to talk about this,

05:07.940 --> 05:10.740
but at the end of the day, how do you think his legacy will be defined?

05:11.400 --> 05:13.380
Well, you know, there's been a lot of praise from Democrats

05:13.380 --> 05:16.880
about Biden's selflessness since his announcement on Sunday,

05:16.880 --> 05:18.920
but the real judgment comes in November.

05:19.300 --> 05:22.400
By realizing he needed to step aside at this very late date,

05:22.580 --> 05:25.140
he foreclosed any possibility of a real primary.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.780
Right now, Democrats are very excited about Vice President Harris

05:28.780 --> 05:31.620
as the likely nominee, but this race is still very close.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.860
If Harris wins, Biden will be remembered as the rare president

05:34.860 --> 05:37.240
who put his party and country ahead of his ego.

05:37.720 --> 05:41.220
If she loses, then he is both the person who removed Trump from office

05:41.220 --> 05:42.720
and ushered him back in.

05:43.080 --> 05:47.000
That is N.P.S. Tamara Keith waking up early again after another late night.

05:47.160 --> 05:47.780
Tam, thank you.

05:48.120 --> 05:48.640
You're welcome.

05:56.800 --> 06:01.340
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the U.S. Congress again yesterday.

06:01.780 --> 06:04.740
He's given addresses to Congress four different times,

06:04.880 --> 06:07.400
which is more than any foreign leader in history.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.620
He's been around for a while.

06:09.220 --> 06:12.540
Netanyahu's latest yesterday included flourishes

06:12.540 --> 06:15.480
often seen in a presidential state-of-the-union address.

06:15.480 --> 06:18.980
He told stories of guests in the audience to illustrate

06:18.980 --> 06:21.660
and defend Israel's war against Hamas.

06:22.020 --> 06:24.320
For the forces of civilization to triumph,

06:25.060 --> 06:28.360
America and Israel must stand together.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.020
Today, the Prime Minister meets President Biden at the White House

06:32.020 --> 06:34.560
and also meets with Vice President Harris

06:34.560 --> 06:39.240
how she engages Netanyahu matters more now that she's running for president.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.080
NPR White House correspondent Asma Khaled is with us now to tell us more about that.

06:43.200 --> 06:43.800
Good morning, Asma.

06:44.240 --> 06:44.680
Good morning.

06:44.680 --> 06:48.600
I wanted to ask you how you characterize the Vice President's policies on Gaza.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.360
I mean, obviously, she's the Vice President,

06:50.480 --> 06:55.840
so you assume that her policies would have to be in lockstep with the presidents.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.260
But what would you say about how she approaches the issue?

07:00.100 --> 07:02.800
Well, the substance of what she's saying is similar to Biden,

07:02.920 --> 07:05.100
but she differs in style and tone.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.920
Harris did describe her as having a, quote,

07:08.100 --> 07:10.580
unwavering commitment to the security of Israel.

07:10.580 --> 07:14.400
I also talked with an advisor from Harris's days in the Senate, Hailey Soyfer,

07:14.700 --> 07:17.220
who told me what it was like at a recent White House event

07:17.220 --> 07:20.060
in which she saw the Vice President take on a real leadership role

07:20.060 --> 07:23.640
in condemning the use of sexual violence in the October 7th attacks.

07:23.940 --> 07:26.100
But really, Michelle, the real difference from Biden

07:26.100 --> 07:28.460
is how Harris talks about people in Gaza.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.960
Take a listen to her comments from this past March in Selma, Alabama.

07:32.440 --> 07:36.220
What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating.

07:36.220 --> 07:42.180
We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed.

07:43.180 --> 07:49.860
Women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care.

07:50.380 --> 07:52.660
I've spoken with multiple people who've remarked to me

07:52.660 --> 07:56.680
that Harris shows a greater degree of empathy for Palestinian civilians

07:56.680 --> 07:58.500
than they have heard publicly from Biden.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.700
Have these words affected how voters see her?

08:02.260 --> 08:05.380
Well, people I've spoken with in the Arab-American community

08:05.380 --> 08:09.100
say that Harris is not viewed as being as toxic as Biden.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.500
I was speaking to Rubel Roman.

08:11.720 --> 08:15.020
She's a Democratic Georgia state legislator, a Palestinian American,

08:15.120 --> 08:16.220
and she put it this way.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.660
I can tell you right now that if I had, for example,

08:18.760 --> 08:21.620
tried to go to a mosque or Arab community event

08:21.620 --> 08:23.220
and urged them to vote for Joe Biden,

08:23.360 --> 08:24.740
I would never be invited back.

08:25.260 --> 08:28.160
The anger was so deep and the hurt was so deep.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.300
Even for me, I tell people that.

08:31.060 --> 08:34.400
And I think people would at least be open to hearing from her

08:34.400 --> 08:36.300
and to let her make her case.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.640
And some Democrats who voted uncommitted during the primaries

08:39.640 --> 08:41.960
told me that they're willing to give Harris a chance.

08:42.140 --> 08:45.340
I mean, to be clear, they are not saying they will definitively vote for her,

08:45.340 --> 08:46.520
but there's a possibility.

08:47.140 --> 08:50.500
I'll also say that Harris was one of the earlier people in the administration

08:50.500 --> 08:54.160
to show a less dismissive response to some of the protests here at home.

08:54.460 --> 08:57.200
Today, she is meeting separately with Israel's Prime Minister,

08:57.560 --> 08:58.380
separately from Biden.

08:58.540 --> 09:00.140
What do you expect from her meeting?

09:00.980 --> 09:04.200
What I'm watching for is how closely she sticks to the president.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.780
You know, she inherits this problem now in her campaign

09:06.780 --> 09:10.440
and following the attack in October that killed more than 1,200 people.

09:10.660 --> 09:13.700
There are now more than 39,000 Palestinians who've been killed

09:13.700 --> 09:15.560
and there's still no ceasefire.

09:15.700 --> 09:18.420
And some people will blame her because she is a part of this administration.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.200
She has a real delicate balancing act

09:21.200 --> 09:24.240
where she's going to try not to alienate supporters of Israel

09:24.240 --> 09:26.620
who make up a key part of the Democratic Party,

09:26.620 --> 09:31.500
but she's also trying to win back some of the young, progressive, brown and black voters

09:31.500 --> 09:34.560
whom Biden alienated with some of his decisions about this war.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.220
That is NPR's Asma Khaled. Asma, thank you.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.640
Good to talk to you.

09:47.060 --> 09:50.960
Vice President Harris faces another fundamental challenge to win the election.

09:51.340 --> 09:55.040
The likely Democratic nominee will have to hold together a broad coalition,

09:55.040 --> 09:57.280
and they have some very different views on some issues.

09:57.700 --> 10:01.240
President Biden managed this in 2020, but the coalition has frayed

10:01.240 --> 10:03.740
as we've just heard, and Harris is a different figure.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.760
Her challenge becomes plain what comes to her record in law enforcement.

10:07.160 --> 10:10.220
My co-host Steve Inskeep has been talking with voters in western Pennsylvania.

10:10.220 --> 10:11.360
Steve, what did you find out?

10:11.840 --> 10:15.100
Well, some contrasting opinions of a big part of Harris's resume.

10:15.360 --> 10:19.400
Her history as a San Francisco prosecutor in California Attorney General.

10:19.560 --> 10:23.360
She raised this in her first campaign event

10:23.360 --> 10:26.280
while running for president talking of Donald Trump and saying,

10:26.640 --> 10:29.780
as a prosecutor, she knew what a predator was or a fraudster.

10:30.560 --> 10:33.860
How voters take that message depends on who you talk to.

10:34.060 --> 10:37.940
On NPR's Morning Edition yesterday, we heard Kathleen Madonna Emerling,

10:38.400 --> 10:41.420
a Democratic Party activist in the Pittsburgh suburbs,

10:41.600 --> 10:43.140
who really likes her new candidate.

10:43.500 --> 10:48.460
My first thought was, this is the ideal suburban candidate

10:48.460 --> 10:54.660
because she straddles the line between being approachable,

10:55.500 --> 11:01.440
relatable, joyful event, while also having incredible public safety credentials.

11:01.800 --> 11:08.860
Because often in the suburbs, people want someone who is pro-public safety, pro-police.

11:09.320 --> 11:13.500
Because many people in her suburb have military or police backgrounds.

11:13.500 --> 11:19.800
And when you can say, this is a clear case of a prosecutor against a felon, it's a home run.

11:20.240 --> 11:24.560
Although for some people in the Democratic Coalition, Michelle, this is a more complicated subject.

11:24.720 --> 11:29.420
And I can co-sign that because I have, as they say, people of that way where you are.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.580
So what is another way people see the vice president's record?

11:33.020 --> 11:35.720
As a potential mark against her.

11:36.020 --> 11:39.260
I also went into central Pittsburgh this week to the Hill District,

11:39.260 --> 11:43.160
which is a historically black neighborhood, and talked with Adrienne Dilworth.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.480
She said she had mixed feelings about Harris.

11:46.720 --> 11:50.560
We spoke here while dodging cars in a grocery store parking lot.

11:50.820 --> 11:57.340
I think they should have put out a broader net for candidates to see who could be actually the best

11:57.340 --> 12:01.860
and not just, you know, like, okay, we're just going to push the VP for the position.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.180
Why do you have mixed feelings about vice president Harris?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.660
Just some of her history.

12:08.220 --> 12:09.800
We better get away from this.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.600
It would be bad for the interview if you run over in the middle here.

12:14.600 --> 12:15.820
Yeah, no, we're not going to have that.

12:16.360 --> 12:23.260
From just some of what I'm hearing from what of her history of some of the people that she's had incarcerated in the past.

12:24.180 --> 12:27.180
She was referring to part of Harris' record as a prosecutor.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.780
She fought to put people in prison.

12:29.120 --> 12:32.840
Sometimes she clashed with civil rights groups and activists over her decisions.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.360
And she's been attacked over the years on the left for this.

12:36.620 --> 12:39.300
Now the attack is being repeated by Republicans.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.540
I guess you could say that Republicans are just trolling here,

12:42.540 --> 12:46.880
but they are also explicitly seeking some of the black vote for Donald Trump.

12:47.040 --> 12:53.820
And you can see where that might resonate with some people in a community that has had this complicated, as you say, relationship with law enforcement.

12:54.160 --> 12:57.000
Oh, yeah, I've interviewed people in that same neighborhood in past years,

12:57.000 --> 13:03.600
and I once met a voter who was 22 and said she'd already been jailed twice for things that she said she didn't do.

13:04.360 --> 13:07.940
So to hold together that Democratic coalition, Harris needs law and order people

13:07.940 --> 13:12.900
and also people who are skeptical of law and order as it is sometimes practiced in the United States,

13:12.940 --> 13:15.100
and we can expect her record to be scrutinized.

13:15.460 --> 13:19.800
Although I should add in that same neighborhood, I also found people who were very eager to vote for Harris,

13:20.020 --> 13:23.340
excited to vote for a woman, and they were organizing with a new intensity.

13:23.340 --> 13:26.840
That is Steve Inskiep in Pittsburgh. Steve, thank you.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.460
Glad to do it.

13:32.020 --> 13:35.660
And that's up first for Thursday, July 25th. I'm Michelle Martin.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.800
And I'm Steve Inskiep. Consider this.

13:38.180 --> 13:41.980
Kamala Harris will not be the first woman to lead a major party's presidential ticket,

13:42.040 --> 13:44.080
but will be the first woman of color.

13:44.500 --> 13:49.460
And though her nomination is not yet official, she's already the subject of racist attacks.

13:49.940 --> 13:52.700
How does that affect her candidacy? Listen to consider this.

13:52.700 --> 13:57.920
