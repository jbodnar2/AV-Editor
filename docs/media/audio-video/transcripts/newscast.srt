1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,840
Okay. All right. I heard that. It's the Thursday sigh. One more day.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,180
Yeah, there we go. The Thursday sigh. It's Thursday, July 25th.

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,920
President Biden explained his decision to step aside in a speech from the Oval Office.

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,380
I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch for a new generation.

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,120
What's on the agenda for his remaining time in office?

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,260
I'm Stephen Skeep with Michelle Martin, and this is Up First from NPR News.

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,640
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets President Biden today

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,740
and will meet separately with Vice President Harris,

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,780
where do the President and Vice President differ on Israel and Gaza?

10
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,940
And voters are paying attention to how Kamala Harris' record on law enforcement

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,600
could play out in a contest against Donald Trump.

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,240
When you can say this is a clear case of a prosecutor against a felon,

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,540
it's a home run.

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,060
Potential savings will vary.

35
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,700
President Biden did not want to end his bid for reelection,

36
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,260
but he said the stakes were just too high to risk it.

37
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:27,260
I believe I reckon as president, my leadership in the world,

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,500
my vision for America's future, all married at a second term,

39
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,080
but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy.

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,600
That includes personal ambition.

41
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,560
So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch for a new generation.

42
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,600
The president spoke of his decision to step aside

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
and also asserted that he still has work to do

44
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,680
in his final six months behind the Oval Office desk

45
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,200
from which he addressed the nation.

46
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,080
Joining us now to talk more about this

47
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,680
is NPR senior White House correspondent Tamra Keith

48
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,200
up again early after a long night, Tam.

49
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,600
Yeah, good morning.

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,520
Thanks for doing that.

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,840
So what was Biden trying to accomplish with this address?

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:13,060
Well, this was a monumental moment for Biden,

53
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,780
marking the end or at least the beginning of the end

54
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,800
of a very long career in public life.

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,080
And his family sat lining the walls of the Oval Office as he spoke.

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,660
The first lady, his grandkids, his kids,

57
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,060
he spoke as Steve said from behind the resolute desk,

58
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,940
this place of very serious presidential addresses.

59
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,140
And this was about explaining the very difficult decision

60
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,400
he made to step aside

61
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,640
and putting it in a noble light.

62
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,320
He was also making an appeal to the American people

63
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,900
to think about what kind of country they want.

64
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,340
At the very end,

65
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,720
Biden delivered this emotional expression of gratitude,

66
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,620
saying that he had given his heart and soul to the nation

67
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,320
over 50 years in public life

68
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,820
and has been blessed with the love and support

69
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,000
of the American people.

70
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,780
I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.

71
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,920
The great thing about America is here,

72
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,840
kings and dictators do not rule, the people do.

73
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,380
This wasn't the place for the overtly political language

74
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,800
you would hear at a campaign rally.

75
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,880
So he never said former President Trump's name,

76
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,080
but the subtext was quite clear.

77
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,040
It was clear,

78
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,940
but you know the speech had the feeling of a farewell address,

79
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,940
Tam, but he still has six months left in office.

80
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,660
What did he say he wants to do at the time he is left?

81
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,360
You know, it really felt like the oxygen drained out of his presidency

82
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,960
when he announced he was dropping out of the race for reelection.

83
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,060
But practically speaking, this term was already in a lame duck phase.

84
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,240
His biggest achievements happened

85
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,100
before Democrats lost control of the House in 2023.

86
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,960
So a lot of what he can do in these final months is implementation,

87
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,360
distributing funds for infrastructure and climate projects,

88
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,780
cementing regulations.

89
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,300
He said he is going to keep fighting for reproductive rights

90
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,060
and civil rights.

91
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,280
He's going to keep working on the economy and trying to lower costs

92
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,440
and he'll speak out against extremism and political violence.

93
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,100
And of course, he is still trying very hard to get a ceasefire

94
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,840
for hostages deal in Gaza.

95
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,900
Tam, we have a lot of time to talk about this,

96
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,740
but at the end of the day, how do you think his legacy will be defined?

97
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,380
Well, you know, there's been a lot of praise from Democrats

98
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,880
about Biden's selflessness since his announcement on Sunday,

99
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,920
but the real judgment comes in November.

100
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,400
By realizing he needed to step aside at this very late date,

101
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,140
he foreclosed any possibility of a real primary.

102
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,780
Right now, Democrats are very excited about Vice President Harris

103
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,620
as the likely nominee, but this race is still very close.

104
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,860
If Harris wins, Biden will be remembered as the rare president

105
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,240
who put his party and country ahead of his ego.

106
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,220
If she loses, then he is both the person who removed Trump from office

107
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,720
and ushered him back in.

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,000
That is N.P.S. Tamara Keith waking up early again after another late night.

109
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,780
Tam, thank you.

110
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,640
You're welcome.

111
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,340
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to the U.S. Congress again yesterday.

112
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,740
He's given addresses to Congress four different times,

113
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,400
which is more than any foreign leader in history.

114
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,620
He's been around for a while.

115
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:12,540
Netanyahu's latest yesterday included flourishes

116
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,480
often seen in a presidential state-of-the-union address.

117
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,980
He told stories of guests in the audience to illustrate

118
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,660
and defend Israel's war against Hamas.

119
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,320
For the forces of civilization to triumph,

120
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,360
America and Israel must stand together.

121
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,020
Today, the Prime Minister meets President Biden at the White House

122
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,560
and also meets with Vice President Harris

123
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,240
how she engages Netanyahu matters more now that she's running for president.

124
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,080
NPR White House correspondent Asma Khaled is with us now to tell us more about that.

125
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,800
Good morning, Asma.

126
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,680
Good morning.

127
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,600
I wanted to ask you how you characterize the Vice President's policies on Gaza.

128
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,360
I mean, obviously, she's the Vice President,

129
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,840
so you assume that her policies would have to be in lockstep with the presidents.

130
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,260
But what would you say about how she approaches the issue?

131
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,800
Well, the substance of what she's saying is similar to Biden,

132
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,100
but she differs in style and tone.

133
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,920
Harris did describe her as having a, quote,

134
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,580
unwavering commitment to the security of Israel.

135
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,400
I also talked with an advisor from Harris's days in the Senate, Hailey Soyfer,

136
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,220
who told me what it was like at a recent White House event

137
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,060
in which she saw the Vice President take on a real leadership role

138
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,640
in condemning the use of sexual violence in the October 7th attacks.

139
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,100
But really, Michelle, the real difference from Biden

140
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,460
is how Harris talks about people in Gaza.

141
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,960
Take a listen to her comments from this past March in Selma, Alabama.

142
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,220
What we are seeing every day in Gaza is devastating.

143
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:42,180
We have seen reports of families eating leaves or animal feed.

144
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,860
Women giving birth to malnourished babies with little or no medical care.

145
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,660
I've spoken with multiple people who've remarked to me

146
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,680
that Harris shows a greater degree of empathy for Palestinian civilians

147
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,500
than they have heard publicly from Biden.

148
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,700
Have these words affected how voters see her?

149
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,380
Well, people I've spoken with in the Arab-American community

150
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,100
say that Harris is not viewed as being as toxic as Biden.

151
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,500
I was speaking to Rubel Roman.

152
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,020
She's a Democratic Georgia state legislator, a Palestinian American,

153
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,220
and she put it this way.

154
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,660
I can tell you right now that if I had, for example,

155
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,620
tried to go to a mosque or Arab community event

156
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,220
and urged them to vote for Joe Biden,

157
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,740
I would never be invited back.

158
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,160
The anger was so deep and the hurt was so deep.

159
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,300
Even for me, I tell people that.

160
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,400
And I think people would at least be open to hearing from her

161
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,300
and to let her make her case.

162
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,640
And some Democrats who voted uncommitted during the primaries

163
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,960
told me that they're willing to give Harris a chance.

164
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,340
I mean, to be clear, they are not saying they will definitively vote for her,

165
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,520
but there's a possibility.

166
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,500
I'll also say that Harris was one of the earlier people in the administration

167
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,160
to show a less dismissive response to some of the protests here at home.

168
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,200
Today, she is meeting separately with Israel's Prime Minister,

169
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,380
separately from Biden.

170
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,140
What do you expect from her meeting?

171
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,200
What I'm watching for is how closely she sticks to the president.

172
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,780
You know, she inherits this problem now in her campaign

173
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,440
and following the attack in October that killed more than 1,200 people.

174
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,700
There are now more than 39,000 Palestinians who've been killed

175
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,560
and there's still no ceasefire.

176
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,420
And some people will blame her because she is a part of this administration.

177
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,200
She has a real delicate balancing act

178
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,240
where she's going to try not to alienate supporters of Israel

179
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,620
who make up a key part of the Democratic Party,

180
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,500
but she's also trying to win back some of the young, progressive, brown and black voters

181
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,560
whom Biden alienated with some of his decisions about this war.

182
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,220
That is NPR's Asma Khaled. Asma, thank you.

183
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,640
Good to talk to you.

184
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,960
Vice President Harris faces another fundamental challenge to win the election.

185
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,040
The likely Democratic nominee will have to hold together a broad coalition,

186
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,280
and they have some very different views on some issues.

187
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,240
President Biden managed this in 2020, but the coalition has frayed

188
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,740
as we've just heard, and Harris is a different figure.

189
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,760
Her challenge becomes plain what comes to her record in law enforcement.

190
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,220
My co-host Steve Inskeep has been talking with voters in western Pennsylvania.

191
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,360
Steve, what did you find out?

192
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,100
Well, some contrasting opinions of a big part of Harris's resume.

193
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,400
Her history as a San Francisco prosecutor in California Attorney General.

194
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,360
She raised this in her first campaign event

195
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,280
while running for president talking of Donald Trump and saying,

196
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,780
as a prosecutor, she knew what a predator was or a fraudster.

197
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,860
How voters take that message depends on who you talk to.

198
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,940
On NPR's Morning Edition yesterday, we heard Kathleen Madonna Emerling,

199
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,420
a Democratic Party activist in the Pittsburgh suburbs,

200
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,140
who really likes her new candidate.

201
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,460
My first thought was, this is the ideal suburban candidate

202
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,660
because she straddles the line between being approachable,

203
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,440
relatable, joyful event, while also having incredible public safety credentials.

204
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,860
Because often in the suburbs, people want someone who is pro-public safety, pro-police.

205
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,500
Because many people in her suburb have military or police backgrounds.

206
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,800
And when you can say, this is a clear case of a prosecutor against a felon, it's a home run.

207
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,560
Although for some people in the Democratic Coalition, Michelle, this is a more complicated subject.

208
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,420
And I can co-sign that because I have, as they say, people of that way where you are.

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,580
So what is another way people see the vice president's record?

210
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,720
As a potential mark against her.

211
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,260
I also went into central Pittsburgh this week to the Hill District,

212
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,160
which is a historically black neighborhood, and talked with Adrienne Dilworth.

213
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,480
She said she had mixed feelings about Harris.

214
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,560
We spoke here while dodging cars in a grocery store parking lot.

215
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:57,340
I think they should have put out a broader net for candidates to see who could be actually the best

216
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,860
and not just, you know, like, okay, we're just going to push the VP for the position.

217
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,180
Why do you have mixed feelings about vice president Harris?

218
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,660
Just some of her history.

219
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,800
We better get away from this.

220
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,600
It would be bad for the interview if you run over in the middle here.

221
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,820
Yeah, no, we're not going to have that.

222
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:23,260
From just some of what I'm hearing from what of her history of some of the people that she's had incarcerated in the past.

223
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,180
She was referring to part of Harris' record as a prosecutor.

224
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,780
She fought to put people in prison.

225
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,840
Sometimes she clashed with civil rights groups and activists over her decisions.

226
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,360
And she's been attacked over the years on the left for this.

227
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,300
Now the attack is being repeated by Republicans.

228
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,540
I guess you could say that Republicans are just trolling here,

229
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,880
but they are also explicitly seeking some of the black vote for Donald Trump.

230
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:53,820
And you can see where that might resonate with some people in a community that has had this complicated, as you say, relationship with law enforcement.

231
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, yeah, I've interviewed people in that same neighborhood in past years,

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,600
and I once met a voter who was 22 and said she'd already been jailed twice for things that she said she didn't do.

233
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,940
So to hold together that Democratic coalition, Harris needs law and order people

234
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,900
and also people who are skeptical of law and order as it is sometimes practiced in the United States,

235
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,100
and we can expect her record to be scrutinized.

236
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,800
Although I should add in that same neighborhood, I also found people who were very eager to vote for Harris,

237
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,340
excited to vote for a woman, and they were organizing with a new intensity.

238
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,840
That is Steve Inskiep in Pittsburgh. Steve, thank you.

239
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,460
Glad to do it.

240
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,660
And that's up first for Thursday, July 25th. I'm Michelle Martin.

241
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,800
And I'm Steve Inskiep. Consider this.

242
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,980
Kamala Harris will not be the first woman to lead a major party's presidential ticket,

243
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,080
but will be the first woman of color.

244
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,460
And though her nomination is not yet official, she's already the subject of racist attacks.

245
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,700
How does that affect her candidacy? Listen to consider this.

246
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,920
Today's episode of Up First was edited by Roberta Rampton, Gabriel Spitzer, Dana Farrington,

247
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,820
Janea Williams, and Alice Wolfley.

248
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,120
It was produced by Ziad Butch, Ben Abrams, and Milton Guevara.

249
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,480
We get engineering support from Carly Strange and our technical director, Zach Coleman.
