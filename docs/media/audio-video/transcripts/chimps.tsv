158620	159980	All right, Elsa, you're our guest.
160140	163620	We want to make you feel welcome, you know, happy.
164220	165880	Which topic do you want to start with first?
166240	169280	Well, of course I want to start with the gesticulating chimpanzees.
169660	169940	Right.
169940	174220	Let me ask, do they use their hands as much as I do to communicate?
174660	176800	Okay, yeah, chimps definitely do.
176980	181100	I mean, they don't have full-blown language like we do, so gestures are really important for communication.
181540	183140	Can I show you a clip of that?
183140	184040	Oh, yes, please.
185480	189720	Okay, so these are two chimpanzees in a tree.
189860	191200	They just had some conflict.
191740	196280	And you can see that one chimp reaches for the other chimp's hand like, I'm sorry.
196280	200200	And after a pause, the other chimp gently taps their hand back.
200600	202200	It looks so tender.
202580	204800	I'm watching this, like, they're really making up.
204940	205520	Is that happening?
206100	207120	Yeah, I mean, maybe.
207520	212220	So, like, gestural exchanges like this are the topic of a recent paper in the journal Current Biology.
212860	219780	Gal Badihi is a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and the lead author of this paper.
219980	222700	And my part was the East African chimpanzees.
222700	228500	Sweeping an enormous data set, Gal looked at exchanges among five wild chimpanzee populations.
228940	232900	Usually, these exchanges had, like, two parts, hand reach, hand tap back.
233280	238000	But sometimes, these exchanges had up to seven parts, which was super exciting to see.
238160	243080	Because they seem to have this back and forth in a face-to-face communicative setup
243080	246220	that kind of resembles human conversations a little bit more.
246480	247560	That's so cool.
247860	252200	And they're sure that it has nothing to do with the sounds that they're uttering towards each other.
252200	253460	It's just the gestures?
253880	257900	Well, they are making sounds, but the gestures is what they were really paying attention to
257900	260480	because of the pacing of the gestures.
260760	263520	Like, the back and forth was really similar to human conversation.
263740	269600	The pause between a gesture and a gestural response averaged to about 120 milliseconds.
269920	270540	This is really fast.
270760	272900	Okay, well, how close is that to human response?
273260	277060	Yeah, conversational turns and humans averaged to about 200 milliseconds across language.
277220	279560	Again, all very rapid fire, all very fast.
279660	280860	I had no idea there was a rate.
280860	285280	Anyway, if chimps are supposed to be like one of our closest living relatives, right?
285400	289260	Like, does this reveal anything about the evolution of how humans communicate?
289740	291520	It presents an intriguing possibility.
291900	297540	Yeah, that this kind of back and forth communication may have evolved before humans split off from great apes.
297780	302340	We don't know for sure, but several primatologists I spoke to who were not a part of the study
302340	309080	all felt this was an important contribution to understanding how turn-taking and communication dynamics evolved.
309440	310420	No language required.
310420	312240	That is so fascinating.
312840	317400	Okay, now we're going to take a sharp turn and move to oxygen on the sea floor.
317880	320460	I take it that that is a weird thing, right?
320620	322320	Otherwise, we would not be talking about it.
322640	326060	Yeah, so most of our oxygen is created through photosynthesis.
326340	332000	That's when, you know, plants take in light, water, and carbon dioxide, and then they make, like, sugar and oxygen.
332360	337180	But for over a decade, scientists were aware of traces of oxygen at the bottom of the ocean,
337180	343540	like three miles down where there's no light, no photosynthesis, so where did this oxygen come from?
344300	347960	And a new study in the journal Nature Geoscience may have an answer.
348340	355940	It shows that oxygen produced without light, called dark oxygen, could be coming from bits of metal in the deep ocean.
356100	359880	Wait, metal? What kind of metal is in the deep sea?
359980	361400	Like, how did it get all the way down there?
361400	367840	It's these clumps of metals, like nickel, manganese, cobalt, iron, that form these nodules on the sea floor.
368120	371580	And they grow on top of stuff that falls to the bottom, like shark teeth.
371940	377200	Yeah, I talked to physical chemist Franz Geiger about this, and he's one of the paper's co-authors,
377340	379500	and he studied these clumps of metal in the lab.
379820	385580	He specified it's not a rock, and these nodules grow one millimeter per million years.
385580	391820	And these are a few centimeters big, so these clumps of metal accumulated over millions and millions of years.
392060	392540	Whoa.
392760	395700	Think of like a really, really slow game of Tetris.
396520	406200	Okay, so these clumps of metal grow very, very slowly, they glom together, and how are they producing oxygen?
406380	407880	Like, I thought that is what plants do.
408260	413060	Right, so preliminary experiment suggests it's partly through electrolysis of seawater.
413060	417960	So, electric current in the middle chunk splits ocean water, H2O, into hydrogen and oxygen,
418340	423500	but the sensors they used only detect oxygen, so they need more data before they can be like, sure this is happening.
423680	424280	That's super cool.
424500	430540	Yeah, it was surprising, actually, to the researchers, but there was another surprise that happened along the way.
431280	433000	Franz almost lost the nodules.
433780	443040	He got an email from customs about the package the nodules were in, and they said that soil imports aren't allowed, and they told him...
443040	446640	And I was like, what? I wasn't at faculty meeting when that happened.
446820	447900	Oh, dang customs!
448500	458460	Yeah, well, okay, so he then like scour the shipping rules and found that soil of oceanic origins can be imported without any issues in this save the nodule samples.
458460	460880	Soil of oceanic origin loophole!
461180	461840	Yes, okay.
462400	464380	Your legal background is coming through.
464880	465040	Yes.
465680	473340	I want to stay in the ocean. Our final story is about waves gone rogue. What the heck, guys?
473880	480500	Yeah, so rogue waves are these abnormally large waves that seem to come out of nowhere and they endanger ships at sea.
480840	486260	Our colleague Nell Greenfield-Boys reported that advances in AI could someday help predict them.
486500	491760	Huh, okay, so when you say abnormally large waves, like how big are we talking?
491760	497480	For a wave to be rogue, it has to be over twice the size of the surrounding waves at a given time.
497640	499760	So it depends on the size of the waves in the area.
500200	507720	For centuries, scientists thought these waves were a sailing myth, until a scientific instrument managed to record one that measured 84 feet.
508540	515000	Yeah, and rogue waves are dangerous. They can damage ships, infrastructure, cause power failures, and really hurt people.
515280	520580	A cruise ship passenger died and others were injured when a freak wave hit the Viking Polaris in 2022.
520580	521600	Oh my god, that's terrible.
522060	524100	Yeah, there's no way of predicting them.
524320	531640	But a new study suggests that actually it may be possible to use information from floating buoys to give people some advanced warning.
532240	539700	So researchers have developed a computer system that correctly predicted 73% of these rogue waves five minutes before they occurred.
540140	542480	Which is valuable. It's like an earthquake warning, you know?
542940	548520	With some time, oil rig workers or ship passengers can seek shelter, perform emergency shutdowns, or evacuate.
548520	551180	If people on the ocean had a little more time, that would help.
551380	555200	Wow. Well, how did these researchers figure out how to predict these waves?
555840	567120	Yeah, so a researcher with the University of Maryland, Bala Balachandran, and his colleagues trained a neural network using data from 172 buoys off the coast of the continental U.S. and the Pacific Islands.
567600	577980	All of that data helped train the computer system to recognize waves that occurred right before a rogue wave happened, and also to distinguish them from waves that weren't followed by a rogue wave.
577980	586520	The scientists say they still have to improve the system's accuracy, but this could be the start of a powerful tool that could even lead to better forecasting for other extreme events.
586900	587700	That's pretty awesome.
588080	591540	Yeah, it really is. And Elsa, thank you so much for hanging out with us.
